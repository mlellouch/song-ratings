When they see you out with me

Goodness knows
You're my honeysuckle rose

When you're passin' by flowers droop and sigh,
And I know the reason why

Goodness knows
You're my honeysuckle rose

Don't buy sugar
You just have to touch my cup
You're my sugar
It's sweeter when you stir it up

When I'm taking sips from your tasty lips
Seems the honey fairly drips

It echoes somewhere within my heart

3,97,'Til Reveille,BING CROSBY,1941,"On a Sunday morn sat a maid forlorn
With her sweetheart by her side,
Through the windowpane, she looked at the rain,
""We must stay home, Joe,"" she cried.
""There's a picnic, too, at the old Point View,
It's a shame it rained today.""
Then the boy drew near, kissed away each tear,
And she heard him softly say,
""Wait till the sun shines, Nellie,
When the clouds go drifting by,
We will be happy, Nellie,
Don't you sigh.

Down Lover's Lane we'll wander,
Sweethearts you and I.
Wait till the sun shines, Nellie,
Bye and bye.""

""How I long,"" she sighed, ""for a trolley ride
Just to show my brand new gown.""
Then she gazed on high with a gladsome cry
For the sun came shining down.
And she looked so sweet on the big front seat
As the car sped on its way,
And she whispered low,
""Say you're all right, Joe,
You just won my heart today.",5,3,4,6

But the note they end on
Will depend on
Little pleasures they will share

I like New York in June, how about you?
I like a Gershwin tune, how about you?
I love a fireside when a storm is due.
I like potato chips, moonlight and motor trips,
How about you?
I'm mad about good books, can't get my fill,
And Franklin Roosevelt's looks give me a thrill.
Holding hands at the movie show,
When all the lights are low
May not be new, but I like it,
How about you?

I like Jack Benny's jokes.
To a degree.
I love the common folks.
That includes me.
I like to window shop on 5th Avenue.
I like banana splits, late supper at the Ritz,
How about you?
I love to dream of fame, maybe I'll shine.
I'd love to see your name right beside mine.
I can see we're in harmony,
Looks like we both agree
On what to do,
And I like it, how about you?",5,2,3,4

He put it right on the air

Downtown, added some tricks
No town, makes it sound, the same
As where it came from

So if you don't feel so hot
Go out to some Jersey spot
And whether you're hep or not
The Jersey bounce'll make you swing

How I love that Jersey bounce

Oh come on and play that Jersey bounce

But when you hear the phrase
""It's you I adore""

To give love a start
Don't think with your mind
Just feel with your heart

Can anyone explain the wonder of love? No no no
But now that you and I
Are sharing a sigh
We know, you can't miss it, yes, we know",5,2,6,3

This magic spell you cast
This is la vie en rose

When you kiss me, heaven sighs
And though I close my eyes
I see la vie en rose

When you press me to your heart
I'm in a world apart
A world where roses bloom

And when you speak
Angels fly from above
Everyday words seem to turn
Into love songs

Give your heart and soul to me
Babe, it's gonna be
La vie en rose

Deceiving me, grieving me, leaving me blue

Could be better had I never known a lover such as you
Forsaking dreams and all for the siren call of your arms

What evil star is mine, that my fate's design should be Jezebel?

The way a wanderin' gypsy
Loves the changing sea
Just like the restless river
Loves old New Orleans

I love a tiny village
A quiet country town
A house, a little garden
With kiddies runnin' 'round
You'd be a faithful husband
I'd be a trusty friend
Until I heard that steamboat
Comin' 'round the bend

And when you smiled at me,
In my heart I felt a thrill you see,
That it was love at sight and
I was right to love you as I do.
Still I never dreamed that you could love me too.

Your eyes of blue, your kisses too,
I never knew what they could do.
I can't believe that you're in love with me.

You're telling ev'ry one I know
I'm on your mind each place we go
They can't believe that you're in love with me.

I have always placed you far above me.
I just can't imagine that you love me.
And after all is said and done,
To think that I'm the lucky one.
I can't believe that you're in love with me.

Skies are gray. I'm blue each day
When you are not around.
Ev'ry thing goes wrong, my dear I've found
But when you're by my side I fill with pride
For I'm so proud of you
It all seems too good to me to all be true

Your eyes of blue, your kisses too,
I never knew what they could do.
I can't believe that you're in love with me.

You're telling ev'ry one I know
I'm on your mind each place we go

Sorry ya can't get through
Why don't you leave your name
And your number
And I'll get back to you
Hey how are ya doin'
Sorry ya can't get through
But leave your name (uh)
And your number
And I'll get back to you

Once again it's another rap bandit
Fiending at I and I can't stand it
Wanna be down with the Day-Glo
Knocking on my door, saying, ""a yo yo""
Knocking on my door, saying, ""a yo yo""
""I got a funky new tune with a fly banjo""
I can't understand what the problem is
I find it hard enough dealing with my own biz
How'd they get my name and number
Then I stop to think and wonder
Bout a plan, yo man, I gotta step out town
You wanna call me up? Take my number down
It's 222-2222
I got an answering machine that can talk to you
It goes

Hey how ya doin'
Sorry ya can't get through
But leave your name and your number
And I'll get back to you

Yo, check it, exit the old style, enter's the new
But nothing's new 'bout being hawked by a crew
Or should I say flock cause around every block
There's Harry, Dick, and Tom, with a demo in his palm
Now I'm with helping those who want to help themselves
And flaunt a nut that's doggy as in dope
But it's not the mood to hear
The tales of limousines and pails
Of money they'll make like a pro
I be like, ""Yo black, just play me the tape""
But at the show the time to spare I just make
But the songs created in they shacks
Are so wick-wick-wack, situations like this
And now I hate they give me smiles Kool-Aid wide and ask
""Was it def?""
And with the straighest face I be like, ""Hell yes""
I slip them the digits to Papa Prince Paul
So I don't go AWOL but yet I know when they call
They get

Hey how ya doing
Sorry ya can't get through
Why don't you leave your name
And your number
And I'll get back to you
Hey how are ya doin
Sorry you can't get through
Why don't you leave your name and your number
And I'll get back to you
Check it out

Party at the dug-out on Diction Ave
Haven't been to the jam in quite a while
Figure I'll catch up on the latest styles
'Stead piles and piles of demo tapes bi-da miles
All I wanna do is cut on the decks wild
But edition up here bi-da miles to the center
Reliever of duty, Plug One mosies in
And I be like, ""Yo G, Pos does all the producing""

Now woe is me to the third degree
Mase pulls the funny so I make like a bunny
Jettin'
But I'm getting used to this demo abuse
Getting raped and giving birth to a tape
Cause there's no escape from the clutches of a hawker
Attached to my success, sent like a stalker
Make way to my radius playin fly guy
Try to get on my back they force like Luke Sky
Me Myself and I go through this act daily
And rarely do I not
No matter how I dodge some jackal always nails me
No matter what the plot
And even out on tour they be like
""Yo I got a tape to play you back at the hotel""
I be like ""Oh swell""
Unveil the numeric code to dial my room
And tell them to call me at noon
But of course there's no answering machine in my room
But a pretty young adorer
Who I swung on tour
And if it rings while we're alone
She'll answer the phone
And with the quickness she'll recite like a poem

""Hey, you done did the right thing, dial up my ring ring
Now you're waiting on the beep
Say, I would love if you'd sing
The tune to Tru instead of fronting on the speak""
So no problemo, just play the demo
And at the end it's break out time
Please oh please don't press rewind
Cause I'll just lay it down the line

Hey how ya doing
Sorry ya can't get through
Why don't you leave your name and your number
And I'll get back to you

Hey how ya doing
Sorry ya can't get through
Why don't you leave your name and your number
And we'll get back to you peace",4,6,3,2

Doo, doo, doo, doo

We had a quarrel
A teenage quarrel
Now I'm as blue as I know how to be
I can't call you on the phone
I can't even see you at your home

So I'm sending you this present
Just to prove that I'm telling the truth
Dear, I believe you won't laugh when you receive
This rose and a Baby Ruth

(Doo, doo, doo, doo)
(Doo, doo, doo, doo)
(Doo, doo, doo, doo, ahh)

I could have sent you an orchid of some kind
But that's all I had in my jeans at the time

But when we grow up
Some day I'll show up
Just to prove I was telling the truth
I'll kiss you, too, then I'll hand to you
This rose and a Baby Ruth

(Doo, doo, doo, doo)

If you cant find a partner use a wooden chair.
Lets rock, everybody, lets rock.

No ones lookin, nows our chance to make a break.

For what else could the ingenue

And so I wrote a random note

A harmony or two
And when it came to add the words
I tried describing you
A very precious love
Is what you are to me
A stairway to a star

A night in Shangril of ecstasy
Lanterns of gold
Lanterns of blue
Twinkle in the shadows
While I dance with you
An echo in the wind

Across the summer lake
Is sayin' you should know
That lanterns lose their glow

And hearts can break

Then kiss me tenderly

86,2882,The Ballad Of Thunder Road,ROBERT MITCHUM,1958,"Let me tell the story, I can tell it all
About the mountain boy who ran illegal alcohol
His daddy made the whiskey, son he drove the load
When his engine roared they called the highway ""Thunder Road""

Sometimes into Ashville, sometimes Memphis town
The Revenuers chased him but they couldn't run him down
Each time they thought they had him his engine would explode
He'd go by like they were standing still on ""Thunder Road""

And there was thunder, thunder over ""Thunder Road""
Thunder was his engine and white lightening was his load
And there was moonshine, moonshine to quench the devil's thirst
The law they swore they'd get him but the devil got him first

On the first of April, 1954
A federal man sent word he'd better make his run no more
He said, ""Two-hundred agents were covering the state
Which ever road he tried to take they'd get him sure as fate""

""Son,"" his daddy told him, ""Make this run your last
The tank is filled with 100 proof, you're all tuned up and gassed
Now don't take any chances, if you can't get through
I'd rather have you back again than all that Mountain Dew""

And there was thunder, thunder over ""Thunder Road""
Thunder was his engine and white lightening was his load
And there was moonshine, moonshine to quench the devil's thirst
The law they swore they'd get him but the devil got him first

Roaring out of Harlan, revving up his mill
He shot the Gap at Cumberland and streamed by Maynardville
With G men on his tail light, road block up ahead
The mountain boy took roads that even angels fear to tread

Blazing right through Knoxville, out on Kingston Pike
Then right outside of Bearden, there they made the fatal strike
He left the road at 90, that's all there is to say
The devil got the moonshine and the mountain boy that day

And there was thunder, thunder over ""Thunder Road""
Thunder was his engine and white lightening was his load
And there was moonshine, moonshine to quench the devil's thirst
The law they never got him 'cause the devil got him first
Law they never got him 'cause the devil got him first

Are you warm, are you real Mona Lisa
Or just a cold and lonely, lovely work of art?

Well in a Villa in a little old Italian town
Lives a girl whose beauty shames the rose
Many yearn to love her but their hopes all tumble down
What does she want I guess nobody knows

Tell him of my love
Tell tommy I love him
Tell tommy I miss him
Tell him though I may cry

My love for him will never die
He drove his car in that stockcar race
To win money so we could wed
He wanted so much to make me his wife
Now our love lives on though he lost his life
I'm so lonely without him near
Oh how I miss his warm embrace
I'll love no other I want him to know
Oh little star please tell him so
Tell tommy I love him
Tell tommy I miss him
Tell him though I may cry
My love for him will never die
Although he wanted to give me the world
Why did he do such a reckless thing
Little star he should have realized
I was richer than a queen

Comes the dazzling sunlit rays
Through the back alleys, through the blinds
Another one of them endless days

Honeybees are buzzin'
Leaves begin to stir
I'm in love with my second cousin
I tell myself I could be happy forever with her

I keep listenin' for footsteps
But I ain't ever hearing any
From the boat I fish for bullheads
I catch a lot, sometimes too many

A summer breeze is blowing
A squall is settin' in
Sometimes it's just plain stupid
To get into any kind of wind

Well, the old men 'round here, sometimes they get on
Bad terms with the younger men
Old, young, age don't carry weight
It doesn't matter in the end

One of the boss' hangers-on
Sometimes omes to call at times you least expect
Try to bully ya, strong arm ya, inspire you with fear
It has the opposite effect

There's a new grove of trees on the outskirts of town
The old one is long gone
Timber two-foot six across
Burns with the bark still on

They say times are hard, if you don't believe it
You can just follow your nose
It don't bother me, times are hard everywhere
Well, we'll just have to see how it goes

My old man, he's like some feudal lord
Got more lives than a cat
I never seen him quarrel with my mother even once
Things come alive or they fall flat

You can smell the pine wood burnin'
You can hear the school bell ring
Gotta get up near the teacher if you can
If you want to learn anything

Romeo, he said to Juliet, ""You got a poor complexion
It doesn't give your appearance a very youthful touch""
Juliet said back to Romeo, ""Why don't you just shove off
If it bothers you so much""

They all got out of here any way they could
The cold rain can give you the shivers
They went down the Ohio, the Cumberland, the Tennessee
All the rest of them rebel rivers

If you ever try to interfere with me or cross my path again
You do so at the peril of your own life
I'm not quite as cool or forgiving as I sound
I've seen enough heartaches and strife

My grandfather was a duck trapper
He could do it with just dragnets and ropes
My grandmother could sew new dresses out of old cloth
I don't know if they had any dreams or hopes

I had 'em once though, I suppose
To go along with all the ring dancin' Christmas carols on all the Christmas Eves
I left all my dreams and hopes
Buried under tobacco leaves

Not always easy kicking someone out
Gotta wait a while, it can be an unpleasant task
Sometimes somebody wants you to give something up
And tears or not, it's too much to ask",5,4,3,2

And a thousand violins begin to play
Or it might be the sound of your hello
That music I hear
I get misty the moment you're near

You can say that you're leading me on
But it's just what I want you to do
Don't you notice how hopelessly I'm lost
That's why I'm following you

On my own
Would I wander through this wonderland alone
Never knowing my right foot from my left
My hat from my glove

And washed it away down the kitchen sink

Struck from a great height
By someone who should know better than that

Why you keep crabbin' on my lifestyle? That's Eugene, see, look

All I want is just walk around, feelin' sad inside, that's blue jeans
Yeah, I don't care if y'all sittin' there watchin' me, that's you stream
I don't care about your made up philosophy, I read proverbs, fool
What you mean, ""Get up off the stage, right now""? You came to my concert, fool
It ain't even gotta be like this but I'm fed up, man
They be sayin' I'm prideful when I got my head up, man
Why you tryna come fight me, you ain't even squared up, man
I don't want no smoke 'cause the gang might tear it up, man

I feel like, now, I feel like my spiritual walk is a lot better than where it was
I think because I did grow up in the church and I had this
It was like this pressure to go every Sunday

Yeah, uh, ayy
No church in a while, God, please help out your child
I'm pandemic to my limit, and they treatin' me so foul
I was tryna help my people, felt like Moses for a minute
But these people call me fake and tell they children not to listen
I thought we was family, I thought we was kin, deeper than our skin
I thought we was blood, covered by it for our deepest sins
I ain't been to church in quite a min'
Partially because I'm nervous that these folks won't let me in
I be feelin' like they hate me and lately they twist my words up to bait me
And I try to dispel the rumors, but all that's drivin' me crazy
But if I'm honest, there's some pastors who passionate 'bout my piece
I be wantin' to blame the church but some of it reside with me
I'm finally open to try it, to tour a club or a church
After quarantine, I was like, ""Man, I'm good if I never search""
But I need the people like I need my senses
Hopefully we find consistence and we come to our senses
No church in a while",5,4,2,3

Always make me cry

He said he had to work
So I went to the show alone
They turned down the lights
And turned the projector on

And just as the news of the world started to begin
I saw my darlin' and my best friend walk in

Though I was sittin' there they didn't see
And so they sat right down in front of me
When he kissed her lips I almost died
And in the middle of the color cartoon
I started to cry.

Oh-oh-oh, sa-a-a-d movies
Always make me cry (always makes me cry)
Oh-oh-oh, sa-a-a-d movies
Always make me cry

So I got up and slowly walked on home
And mama saw the tears and said ""what's wrong?""
And so to keep from telling her a lie
I just said ""sa-a-a-d movies
Make me cry"" (make me cry, oh-oh,oh)

Everyone I wanted has wanted someone new
Heartaches hang around they always come

Both in the same direction

Could start a butterfly collection.

You can call me a silly goat
But, ya take two minks add two winks

After three or four dances
Ah, you can just bet she'll play hard to get
To multiply her chances.

She relies on habit
Ya take two hares with no cares

And you pulled the rug right out from under my life
I know where you goin' to, I knew when you came home last night
'Cause your eyes had a mist from the smoke of a distant fire

Lord, I was stunned, shoulda seen it come a long time ago
When I realized, the reality gave me a roll
If things are the same, then explain why your kiss is so cold
And that mist in your eyes feels like rain on the fire
In my soul

This lyin' and cryin' is upsettin' and gettin' nowhere
It don't stack up, so slack up, then pack up, I just don't care
(Don't let the screen door hit you) on your way out
Don't you drown when your dreamboat runs onto the ground

I'd just like to know, do you love him or just makin' time?
By filling his glass with your fast-flowing bittersweet lyin'
You'll face the aftertaste when you come home late some night
With your eyes all a-mist from the smoke of a distant fire

Girl, your eyes have a mist from the smoke of a distant fire
(Girl, your eyes have a mist from the smoke of a distant fire)

A secret my best friend never knew
The brook told the trees and the trees told the breeze
That I was in love with you

The trees told the flowers hiding there by the hilltop
The clouds told the moon that shone above
So angry, yet blue, when they found out that you
And your heart had another love

The brook became angry and changed to a river
Rushing so madly along
The soft summer breeze that played tag with the trees
Became so wild and so strong

The bashful, white flowers hiding there by the hilltop
Grew dark when the rain came pouring down
Their hearts couldn't hide all the tears that were cried
And had carpeted on the ground

The storm passed, gone over, there's sunshine again
The chains that held me are now gone
The trees wave, hello, as I stand here below
And the brook sings the sweetest song

The bashful, white flowers are again by the hilltop
The sun and the moon are still my friends
I promise there'll be no more heartaches for me
Till I fall in love again",4,2,3,5

I used to sing dirty raps to my East Side fans
Back then I knew ya couldn't stop this rap
No M.C. could rock like that
Then the new style came, the bass got deeper
Ya gave up the mike and bought you a beeper
Do ya wanna rap or sell coke?
Brothers like you ain't never broke
People wanna say it's just my time
Brothers like me had to work for mine
Eight years on the mic and I'm not jokin'
Sir Too Short comin' straight from Oakland
California, home of the rock
Eight woofers in the trunk, beatin' down the block
Short dog, I'm that rappin' man
I said it before and I'll say it again

Life is too short
Too short
Life is too short
Too short

Life is to some people unbearable
Committin' suicide and that's terrible
Was it much too much or nothing' big?
If ya live my life, you'd be fightin' to live
Life is to me my main asset
I be doin' all right and keep it just like that
Chill out at the house and pump that bass
I'm tryin' to get rich as I rock the place
Everybody's got that same old dream
To have big money and fancy things
Drive a brand new Benz, keep your bank right here
Never hear me stutter once because I talk real clear
It's on you, homeboy, watcha gonna do?
You can take my advice and start workin', fool
Or you can close your ears and run your mouth
And one day, homeboy, ya soon find out

Life is too short
Too short
Life is too short
(Too short)

Life is too short, would you agree?
While I'm livin' my life, don't mess with me
It's been a long time, baby, since I first got down
But I still keep makin' these funky sounds
Cause I don't stop rappin', that's my theme
I make a lot of money, do you know what I mean?
Like this, complicated ya must stay up
Ya asked a simple question boy, don't say ""What?""
Ya only live once and ya callin' it hell
Policeman tryin' to take ya to jail
You could give a man time but you don't know
I a matter of time, I'll be runnin' the show
Now another young buck wants to be on top
Makin' big money, slangin' hop
The task force tryin' to peel your cap
Turn around, homeboy, ya better watch your back

Life is too short
Life is

You can take back all the things you give
But ya can't take back the days you live
Life is to some people who've been on earth
Livin' every single day for what it's worth
I live my life just how I please
Satisfy one person I know that's me
Work hard for the things I achieve in life
And never rap fake when I'm on the mic
Cause if a dream is all you got, homeboy
Ya gotta turn that dream into the real McCoy
Not time to waste, just get on that case
Ya can't be down 'cause ya need to taste
A good life livin' like a king on a throne
Gettin' everything ya want
And tryin' to have all your own
Its your life
Don't be stupid though
Cause when ya waste it, you'll know

161,6086,Half Time,THE ROUTERS,1963,"Don’t you hear the rain coming
Feel its rush down in your brain
There’s a rumble that calls your name
It’s always been the same

The groundis shaking under your feet
Birds are silent and the moon is gone
People running in the street
We shall run along

All the bed-time stories
And merry-go-rounds
Couldn’t stop that flood
We can blame all worries
On the god of all gods
But no help will be found

Don’t you feel the wind blowing
Its frozen blood that clogs your veins
But no one else to take the blame
It’s always been the same

Don’t you let the drum boom boom in
When it comes to heal your pain
Damned the thunder that calls your name
It’s always been the same game

All the bed-time stories
And merry-go-rounds
Couldn’t stop that flood
We can blame all worries
On the god of all gods
But no help will be found

There no use waiting for the sun
Looking for some fun
Whenthe sky turns black
Doggy sings the blues
And half the moon is back
Let it be like that",5,4,2,3

To tell him what I had to say

Set him free foolishly destiny misery

Brushed a tear from my baby's eye
Walked away didn't know that

You tried for a minute, your laziness failed you
Seeing what can be done with big potential
Must be very painful
Watch where ill be at by April
laughing to the bank and stacking my residuals
No need for me to even try imma finna pistol swap
Throw a blower in his lap these bitches ought to drop
Show em if they owe me money then they better have not forgot
Thinking you can carry on like this, completely lost the plot

Just doing our business

With a switchblade, a martian
Out of space
When I write lines on this paper
I fuckin flip page
Nothin’s changed but the battery
I just pop in another

You better close up the cover
On the back of the controller
Or go remote cause I’m after

Call me V
I’m like Gary
A CEO
The Go- A-T
A goat and I go at
The people who play me
I ain’t talkin
Spinnin my records

Promised myself one day I’d be
goin apeshit
Like Jay-Z
Can’t tame me

And wait for the day I improve

190,7321,Taste Of Tears,JOHNNY MATHIS,1964,"Yesterday when I was young,
The taste of life was sweet as rain upon my tongue,
I teased at life as if it were a foolish game,
The way the evening breeze may tease a candle flame;
The thousand dreams I dreamed,
The splendid things I planned
I always built, alas,
On weak and shifting sand;
I lived by night and shunned the naked light of day
And only now I see how the years ran away

Yesterday, when I was young,
So many happy songs were waiting to be sung,
So many wayward pleasures lay in store for me
And so much pain my dazzled eyes refused to see,

I ran so fast that time and youth at last ran out,
I never stopped to think what life was all about
And every conversation I can now recall concerned itself with me
And nothing else at all

Yesterday the moon was blue,
And every crazy day brought something new to do,
I used my magic age as if it were a wand,
And never saw the waste and emptiness beyond;
The game of love I played with arrogance and pride
And every flame I lit too quickly, quickly died;
The friends I made all seemed somehow to drift away
And only I am left on stage to end the play
There are so many songs in me that won't be sung,
I feel the bitter taste of tears upon my tongue,
The time has come for me to pay for Yesterday
When I was Young

Yesterday, when I was young,
So many happy songs were waiting to be sung,
So many wayward pleasures lay in store for me

Sure as you're born, they bought me a silk suit
Put luggage in my hands,
And I woke up high over Albuquerque
On a jet to the promised land

Workin' on a T-bone steak a la carte
Flying over to the Golden State
Oh when The pilot told me in thirteen minutes
We'd be headin' in the terminal gate

Swing low chariot, come down easy
Taxi to the terminal zone
Cut your engines, cool your wings
And let me make it to the telephone

Los Angeles give me Norfolk Virginia
Tidewater four ten O nine
Tell the folks back home this is the promised land callin'
And the poor boy's on the line",5,4,2,3

did you find a memory or two
Even though the flame has died
Maybe there's a spark inside
Have you looked into your heart

Have you searched through all your dreams
did you ever find a trace of me
Even though you say we're through
That I'm not the one for you
Have you looked into your heart

When the evening shadows
Fall upon my window pane
I find I'm crying over, and over
And over and over and over again

Since we've been apart
All I do is pray for your return
Take a look and you will see
Maybe there's a place for me
Have you looked into your heart",5,2,3,6

Ladies and gentlemen, it's the unit for the 9-8.
Flipmode Squad baby. That's my word.
All you sucker MC's, try to hide this stuff. Come back here.
Where you think you goin', nigga. Come back here.
Y'all niggaz ain't seein' Jack. Shit !!!

Aiiyo, speak the truth.
Too short to let it hurt. Some talk dirt, and be the first slangin' hertz.
Freestylin' of the hum of the birds.
Fall back when I shine on my shine, two shows follow behind.
It's a fucked up vehicle. Switchin' my lines.
Hotel asks a nigga: ""Could I share my dimes"".
Picture that, when you scared to draw toes.
Playin' me close.
Rollin with the dogs wearin' yesterdays clothes.
Left a fouled sin into my squad without permition.
I started dissin', hopin' you listen. Pay attention.
Fatheresly. The shadow leads you back to the hood.
You want to switch up because some niggas stalked you up.
Or is the fact that they thought you was rollin' with us.
Left you all draged, like two trains crashin' it up.

Aiiyo, Spliff Starr drama, bullpen personna
Type of nigga that would sell crack to your mama
Take the cash you gave me and buy marijuana
Check me boy, in some turbo (?)
Back in the days I bubble drugs like a sauna
Make a pussy boy kill himself like Nirvana
Get 'em like goose feathers, cold weather rock the bamma
Lie in front of the jury, D.A., and Your Honor
I represent street niggas, carry heat niggas
Play for keeps niggas, ain't nothin 'bout me sweet, niggas
I stay token, gun butt your skull open
If you fuck wit my squad nigga where you think you goin'?

[Chorus]
Where you think you goin'.
Where you think you goin'.
Aiiyo, what you doin nigga.
Where you think you goin'.
Where you think you goin'.
Where you think you goin'.
Aiiyo, what you movin for.
Where you think you goin'.
Where you think you goin'.
Where you think you goin'
Aiiyo, what you doin nigga.
Where you think you goin'.

You think that you can run (ha)
You think that you can hide (haa)
You best believe you still comin'. I think you better slide.
While you stay bitchin', another nigga missin'.
Bodies snatch you up.! Behold the cream. .
Caught in hells kitchen. My trigger fingers itchin'.
Nervous system's fucked up.
That's why my nerves twitchin'.
Enslave your mentality. Nigga brain fried.
We after you, runnin' sergeon for a free ride.
Where you think you goin' son ?
We gon' catch you soon.
We here to take over this shit.
Pour the tycoon.
Blossom and gloom. Capture any nigga sober in a little dark room.
Ha ha ha ha ha.

Uh oh. You lil league boy I know your beats.
You sound bullshitely, You rock .
Swearin' you to ball, when you know you're wack.
In a studio settin' of a reverands track.
Boy ! Rah gets busy, my shit be way slaver.
Curder rapper Ernest like the one slave labour.
One first be like the bitch tap oil.
Loyal to my niggas. Enemies are fucked around, and riders rappin for you.
Spot stays blowin. Goin' to the top.
Where you think you're goin'.
Pocket stay throwin'. Smooth like the lowin'.
Rap chick flowin'.
Where you think you're goin.

I'm a hard man at work.
Lyrical expert.
Look out before you get hurt.
Bury the dirt. Line for line.
Ramp I be the mastermind.
That's be full time watch me shine.
I know the seven sign.
I'm rich, and still life is a bitch.
Losin' snitch like camey fake beggar.
Jim Baker. I take you're life like the undertaker.
Flipmode moneymaker, make that kill for this paper.
It's on the poppin'.
People want to know when the album droppin'.
Start talkin'. Keep walkin'.
Flatbush New York and we live for you.
Sling for you.
My squad struck oil.
Now we coppin' platinum things.
Diamond rings. Nice cosy things.
And a party for free.
From the tunnel to envy.
Ramp's the rugged MC.
My squad keeps growin.
Where you think you goin.'

Chief gunnin' to.
Splash rain potters pooves.
Fuck is you. Start stand peach.
Chuff for choose.
Scoffer booves.
Now low muscles moves.
Smash crew like statue with jungle jewels.
Son gets school, wit the dummin' crew.
Pay double dues. Cradle to the graves, hustle grooves.
Flesh tissue. Death kiss you. No love for you.
Oh.
And me the most wanted fool.
Unfriendly in horrical, make power moves.
Snatch colors loose. A dollar rule.
Raw business shit in my hands, and shakes yours with it.
Till you 'cause fridget.
Local or long distance.
Gets master served.
And crash a burn
Like James Evans when I'm blowin'.

And the title is Sam's song

Nothin' on your mind
(But the news of the day and the bills you must pay)
(Keep your hair turnin' gray but you're still hummin' Sam's song)
Are you alright, how's your brace
(Why, it makes you grin)
(Gets under your skin as only a song can do)

People that you meet
(Hello Joe, what you know and remind me to Moe)
(Tell him business is slow but I'm whistlin')
Sam's Song, everyone you see
(Has a story to tell or a gimmick to sell)
(But agree that it's swell and it's really)
A grand song

So forget your troubles and wear a smile
You'll find you never go wrong
If you learn to croon like a lark in the park
Who is making his mark serenadin' the dark
With a chorus of Sam's song

If you learn to croon the happy tune
They call it Sam's song",6,2,5,3
223,8575,What A Color (Is A Man),BOBBY VINTON,1965,"Bobby Vinton got me thinking
Maybe I should be distant
Blue Velvet thoughts aren't my wishes
Even though pain lingers after her kisses
I'm not here to reciprocate that sad business
It'll move through me, it'll move through me
Hopefully not to her cause I'm moving soon
It's a natural cycle that I'm not trying to project
But I don't have any choice in how it ends, it's continuing
And I can't catch her from always falling in
So I gotta pay the price for the love her heart's swallowing
I don't keep track of the damage I'm causing, man
But If I stay I'll probably never grow again
Mama told me be careful when you chase
Cause the one you're looking for will be right in your face
They'll find you
When you least expect- just wait
Sometimes this is just a common cause of fate
And I can't catch her from always falling in
Got me thinking, Bobby Vinton
And I can't catch her from always falling in
Bobby Vinton, got me thinking
Blue Velvet thoughts aren't my wishes

Something in your eyes I see
Soon begins bewitching me
It's that old devil moon
That you stole from the skies
It's that old devil moon in your eyes

You and you glance make this romance
Too hot to handle
Stars in the night
Blazing their light
Can't hold a candle
To your razzle-dazzle

You've got me flyin' high and wide
On a magic carpet ride
Full of butterflies inside
Wanna cry, wanna croon
Wanna laugh like a loon

Off you would go in the mist of day

When grass was green and grain was yellow

When you were a tender and callow fellow
Try to remember and if you remember
Then follow follow

Try to remember when life was so tender
That no one wept except the willow
Try to remember the kind of september
When love was an ember about to billow
Try to remember and if you remember

Deep in december it's nice to remember
The fire of september that made us mellow
Deep in december our hearts should remember

It came from a book I was loaned.
It's really terrific and quite scientific
And I'm half stoned.
For breakfast some cornflakes and vodka,
But cornflakes have carbohydrates
So I don't eat those fattening cornflakes,
I eat the vodka straight.
Drink, drink, everyone drink
It's not as bad as we used to think.
With every Manhattan your stomach will flatten,
So drink, drink, drink.

The Air Force invented this diet,
A fact which they hotly deny.
Of course they deny it, cause this is the diet
That got the Air Force high.
For lunch you can have three martinis,
What better lunch is there than that?
But caution: do not eat the olives,
Cause olives make you fat.

Drink, drink, everyone drink;
It's not as bad as we used to think.
If pounds you would burn off, then turn on your Smirnoff,
And drink, drink, drink.

For dinner, a nice Scotch and soda
Now that ought a help you to lose.
No whipped cream, no butter, just lay in the gutter
And booze, booze, booze.
Suppose you should meet a policeman,
Who says you've been quenching your thirst
You just tell him it's physical fitness
And health comes first!

Drink (hick), drink (hick), booze everywhere (hick)
Pass that decanter of bourbon there.

You made everything alright

'Cause you're all I need

246,9159,Dum-De-Da,BOBBY VINTON,1966,"Bobby Vinton got me thinking
Maybe I should be distant
Blue Velvet thoughts aren't my wishes
Even though pain lingers after her kisses
I'm not here to reciprocate that sad business
It'll move through me, it'll move through me
Hopefully not to her cause I'm moving soon
It's a natural cycle that I'm not trying to project
But I don't have any choice in how it ends, it's continuing
And I can't catch her from always falling in
So I gotta pay the price for the love her heart's swallowing
I don't keep track of the damage I'm causing, man
But If I stay I'll probably never grow again
Mama told me be careful when you chase
Cause the one you're looking for will be right in your face
They'll find you
When you least expect- just wait
Sometimes this is just a common cause of fate
And I can't catch her from always falling in
Got me thinking, Bobby Vinton
And I can't catch her from always falling in
Bobby Vinton, got me thinking
Blue Velvet thoughts aren't my wishes

Bobby Vinton, got me thinking
And I can't catch her from always falling in",5,2,3,4

251,9323,If He Walked Into My Life,EYDIE GORME,1966,"Where's that boy with the bugle?
My little love was always my big romance
Where's that boy with the bugle?
And why did I ever buy him those damn long pants?

Did he need a stronger hand?
Did he need a lighter touch?
Was I soft or was I tough?
Did I give enough?
Did I give too much?
At the moment that he needed me
Did I ever turn away?

Would I be there when he called
If he walked into my life today

Were his days a little dull?
Were his nights a little wild?
Did I overstate my plan?
Did I stress the man?
And forget the child
And there must have been a million things
That my heart forgot to say
Would I think of one or two
If he walked into my life today

Should I blame the times I pampered him
Or blame the times I bossed him
What a shame!
I never really found the boy
Before I lost him

Were the years a little fast?
Was his world a little free?
Was there too much of a crowd?
All too lush and loud and not enough for me
Though I'll ask myself my whole life long
What went wrong along the way
Would I make the same mistakes
If he walked into my life today?
If that boy with the bugle
Walked into my life today",4,5,3,6

260,9664,Society's Child (Baby I've Been Thinking),JANIS IAN,1966,"Turns out, our bodies are computers
And in EMDR, trauma was explained to me as an event that overwhelms our senses
So much so, that our brains don't know how to store it
Cannot file it away, so it hovers in our energy, stagnant

A lost document
So it went
Southern California, five years old in gymnastics
My instructor Dean asked me to stay after class

Your head
My lap
Other way
Take a nap

No one will love you if you cry like that
My skin scratched bright red, but he thought I'd comply
But even at five, I had the same hurricane mind, electricity mouth, veins made of lightning
A girl turned burning house

He doused my young body in its first taste of trauma, crumpled my childhood and set it on fire
A popsicle
We'll make it better
Was it banana

Or cherry
I can't fucking remember
So clumsy
A slide

Fell off
Small incident today
No need to worry
They looked

Didn't see me
More hide
Less seek
I think the light is leaving

While the other kids sat rosy-cheeked and laughing, I sat in a corner spelling out sexual words in graham cracker lettering
My soul screaming out sonnets with paper and pen
I think the darkness cracked something in me open
How could they not have noticed

Those adults were in charge of children, the most vulnerable of our society
So I built my vocabulary bigger than the list of names who failed me
My brain an overheated battery trying to sort out what the flashbacks mean
System overload

My mind shut off in an effort to protect me
Bits and pieces of the scene kept me up at night with all the flashing
Four ceiling tiles
Two beads of sweat

Trauma's funny like that
The details it lets you remember in the main event it forces you to forget
I started screaming into pillows when I was alone and I didn't know why
Overflowing my plate five times over at dinner

Trying to fill up this crater inside
I prayed the rosary
Twice
Was still drenched in a sin

Even when the church opens its doors I refuse to walk in
And I still don't know what makes a soul worth saving
And after being cracked so many times it's no wonder we split open
And when I write poems like these I don't know the right spots to put line breaks in

Because everything at once feels like it's breaking
Now I don't sing acapella
Or cry in front of people
When community knocks on my door I can't bring myself to answer it

Ever since he poured his perversion in a cup and forced me to sip
I don't know how to navigate relationships without manipulation
I start to worry about the burn soon as sunlight hits my skin
I remember being in the shower

Meticulously shaving every ounce of human off of me
One day refusing to be touched
The next, hypersexuality
On a scale of one to ten how disturbing is the memory

Well, I would say that it's a ten
For twenty-seven years I felt his hands on every inch of me
Now I wake in the middle of the night
Drenched in sweat

My lovers have told me I fly up in bed in a panic
In the morning my jaw aches
I have to unclench my fists
Now I'm torn between contemplating the weight of accusation and remembering that scar on your chin

And how many more years have you taught at that gym
How many more girls have you done this to
Dean, is it five
Is it ten

After my first EMDR session some of the details still lacked
But no one ever warned me the rage would be the first thing to come back
I swear to God I could drown a whole ocean with it
But how could I not

With those screaming images arriving in flashes
My hips not yet formed
No baby teeth falling out yet
I guess the way I balanced on a beam stirred up your sick sense of pleasure

The younger the girl, the higher the chance she won't remember
But this is what happens when you fuck with a writer
My brain is precise
I memorize six minute poems by the hour

I've come back for you now
Pure hellfire and literature
And did you think you actually stood a chance against my power
As if the ground did not rattle upon my arrival

As if the oceans did not storm in anticipation of the hurricane I will rain down upon you
As I rise up and crash down like the waves
You left me outside in the rain
Like a tattered sheet hung up to dry

But just like Maya Angelou still I rise
And my poems are coming for you
I flew back to California
Healing in hand

Went straight to that gym
And walked my ass in
And I swear on everything holy
You will never lay your hands on a child again

Well Dean
Now that this poem is quickly approaching part two
I kindly request that you look me in the fucking eyes when I'm speaking to you
20 minutes

20 years ago
Tell me
What's the value
And since no one ever told you

When a person says no
That in itself is a complete answer
Zero explanation is required to follow
But I guess that's what happens when you feed blood to a monster

You would think it would change him
But it just makes him grow stronger
So if being beautiful means beaten and bruised
I don't want it

I will cut all my hair off
I will scrub off this makeup
We are conditioned in society based on faulty mathematics
The church of her body set on fire by five different arsonists

And the only thing that we question is how flammable her fabric is
The clothes are not the problem
Did you know that only 23% of sexual assaults go reported a year
Has me thinking that the shame lies not in the women silenced

But in the male privilege that silenced her
When flames devour your skin
There's no question if the burning is real
So I vow to pull poems out of ashes

Until there is nothing left for me to heal
And I've made it a habit of lifting weights at the gym
Vowing that if a man ever tried to hurt me in that way again
He would walk away bleeding

So please
Someone just tell me what I'm needing to do to heal
And I'll do it
I will plant gardens in my throat

Water them with the art that I wrote when they're dry
Abracadabra
What potion do I swallow to make my insides a calm sky
How much my center sees sunlight if my ribcage is windowless

And I've been thinking a lot lately about the human heart
And it's capacity for forgiveness
And I know in the future I will arrive at that place
But to be honest that day hasn't come yet

And I've always longed to speak with Rubik's cube lips
But I'm all Ernest Hemingway
Sprawling my blatancy on the table saying here
All I have is this

And I don't know why the tears come to me some days
Maybe they are a part of me now
But if the rumors are true
If there's something in the water

I wouldn't believe that rivers could drown
Purity is found inside of a heart
It does not live in a body
And it has taken me years to understand that it is not something he ever could have stolen from me

So I vow to be gentle with myself as my mind starts rewiring
I'm ready to change the channel away from this endless loop of a memory
Turns out I'm not American honey
I did not grow up so

Maybe innocence isn't real
Maybe it never was but
I have a spine made of iron and one hell of a soul
And while I can't say what peace feels like

I won't rest till I know
So maybe that's why I find solace in poems
These college-ruled pages are the closest I've ever had to a home
Could a person still love me when these lines run like rivers and all that's left is my soul

Maybe that's why I put off therapy all these years
Could I still be interesting even when I am whole
Turns out our bodies are computers
And in EMDR it was explained to me that in order for our brains to process the trauma

Our minds need to update our systems
Toss out our old patterns
Switch out our camera lens
So I've begun to view this pain as an honor

I rewrote my role in this story from victim to warrior
And maybe God, whatever he, she, or it is
Gives these experiences to the ones that are not only strong enough to handle it
But have the ability to do something about it for all of us

Isn't that love
Isn't that love
This morning I stood in the grocery store aisle
Wondering if the bright sky blend of coffee might finally be the right fit for me

Before a man passed
He asked if anyone had reminded me I was beautiful that day
Well quite frankly sir
I've been told that my entire life

But hadn't felt it till yesterday
Little by little I found myself coming back
Each therapy session chips away at my writer's block
And in the midst of relearning what I am and am not

I found stillness in storms
Despite all that I've lost
And it's safe to say I found my life's work
Building stained glass windows from the shards of my hurt

The deeper the pain the better the poem
So trust me Dean
There's a hundred more where this came from
Turns out

Our bodies are computers
Just waiting for our brains to update our systems
Amazing grace
How sweet the sound

That saved a wretch like me
I once was lost
But now I'm found
It's twenty years later

And I am safe now",5,1,2,7

ARTHUR: Whoa there!
[clop clop]
GUARD #1: Halt! Who goes there?
ARTHUR: It is I, Arthur, son of Uther Pendragon, from the castle
of Camelot. King of the Britons, defeator of the Saxons,
sovereign of all England!
GUARD #1: Pull the other one!
ARTHUR: I am. And this my trusty servant Patsy. We have
ridden the length and breadth of the land in search of knights
who will join me in my court of Camelot. I must speak with your
lord and master.
GUARD #1: What, ridden on a horse?
ARTHUR: Yes!
GUARD #1: You're using coconuts!
ARTHUR: What?
GUARD #1: You've got two empty halves of coconut and you're
bangin' 'em together.
ARTHUR: So? We have ridden since the snows of winter covered
this land, through the kingdom of Mercea, through--
GUARD #1: Where'd you get the coconut?
ARTHUR: We found them.
GUARD #1: Found them? In Mercea? The coconut's tropical!
ARTHUR: What do you mean?
GUARD #1: Well, this is a temperate zone.
ARTHUR: The swallow may fly south with the sun or the house
martin or the plumber may seek warmer climes in winter yet these
are not strangers to our land.
GUARD #1: Are you suggesting coconuts are migratory?
ARTHUR: Not at all, they could be carried.
GUARD #1: What -- a swallow carrying a coconut?
ARTHUR: It could grip it by the husk!
GUARD #1: It's not a question of where he grips it! It's a
simple question of weight ratios! A five ounce bird could not
carry a 1 pound coconut.
ARTHUR: Well, it doesn't matter. Will you go and tell your
master that Arthur from the Court of Camelot is here.
GUARD #1: Listen, in order to maintain air-speed velocity, a
swallow needs to beat its wings 43 times every second, right?
ARTHUR: Please!
GUARD #1: Am I right?
ARTHUR: I'm not interested!
GUARD #2: It could be carried by an African swallow!
GUARD #1: Oh, yeah, an African swallow maybe, but not a European
swallow, that's my point.
GUARD #2: Oh, yeah, I agree with that...
ARTHUR: Will you ask your master if he wants to join my court
at Camelot?!
GUARD #1: But then of course African swallows are not migratory.
GUARD #2: Oh, yeah...
GUARD #1: So they couldn't bring a coconut back anyway...
[clop clop]
GUARD #2: Wait a minute -- supposing two swallows carried it
together?
GUARD #1: No, they'd have to have it on a line.
GUARD #2: Well, simple! They'd just use a standard creeper!

GUARD #2: Well, why not?

WOMAN: No one live there.

take it in turns to act as a sort of executive officer for the
week.
ARTHUR: Yes.

at a special biweekly meeting.
ARTHUR: Yes, I see.
DENNIS: By a simple majority in the case of purely internal
affairs,--
ARTHUR: Be quiet!
DENNIS: --but by a two-thirds majority in the case of more--
ARTHUR: Be quiet! I order you to be quiet!
WOMAN: Order, eh -- who does he think he is?
ARTHUR: I am your king!
WOMAN: Well, I didn't vote for you.
ARTHUR: You don't vote for kings.
WOMAN: Well, 'ow did you become king then?
ARTHUR: The Lady of the Lake, [angels sing] her arm clad in the
purest shimmering samite, held aloft Excalibur from the bosom of
the water signifying by Divine Providence that I, Arthur, was to
carry Excalibur. [singing stops] That is why I am your king!
DENNIS: Listen -- strange women lying in ponds distributing
swords is no basis for a system of government. Supreme executive
power derives from a mandate from the masses, not from some
farcical aquatic ceremony.
ARTHUR: Be quiet!
DENNIS: Well you can't expect to wield supreme executive power
just 'cause some watery tart threw a sword at you!
ARTHUR: Shut up!
DENNIS: I mean, if I went around sayin' I was an empereror just
because some moistened bint had lobbed a scimitar at me they'd
put me away!
ARTHUR: Shut up! Will you shut up!
DENNIS: Ah, now we see the violence inherent in the system.
ARTHUR: Shut up!
DENNIS: Oh! Come and see the violence inherent in the system!
HELP! HELP! I'm being repressed!
ARTHUR: Bloody peasant!

that, eh? That's what I'm on about -- did you see him repressing
me, you saw it didn't you?

WITCH: I'm not a witch. I'm not a witch.
BEDEMIR: But you are dressed as one.
WITCH: They dressed me up like this.
CROWD: No, we didn't -- no.
WITCH: And this isn't my nose, it's a false one.
BEDEMIR: Well?
VILLAGER #1: Well, we did do the nose.
BEDEMIR: The nose?
VILLAGER #1: And the hat -- but she is a witch!
CROWD: Burn her! Witch! Witch! Burn her!
BEDEMIR: Did you dress her up like this?
CROWD: No, no... no ... yes. Yes, yes, a bit, a bit.
VILLAGER #1: She has got a wart.
BEDEMIR: What makes you think she is a witch?
VILLAGER #3: Well, she turned me into a newt.
BEDEMIR: A newt?
VILLAGER #3: I got better.
VILLAGER #2: Burn her anyway!
CROWD: Burn! Burn her!
BEDEMIR: Quiet, quiet. Quiet! There are ways of telling whether
she is a witch.
CROWD: Are there? What are they?
BEDEMIR: Tell me, what do you do with witches?
VILLAGER #2: Burn!
CROWD: Burn, burn them up!
BEDEMIR: And what do you burn apart from witches?
VILLAGER #1: More witches!
VILLAGER #2: Wood!
BEDEMIR: So, why do witches burn?
[pause]
VILLAGER #3: B--... 'cause they're made of wood...?
BEDEMIR: Good!
CROWD: Oh yeah, yeah...
BEDEMIR: So, how do we tell whether she is made of wood?
VILLAGER #1: Build a bridge out of her.
BEDEMIR: Aah, but can you not also build bridges out of stone?
VILLAGER #2: Oh, yeah.
BEDEMIR: Does wood sink in water?
VILLAGER #1: No, no.
VILLAGER #2: It floats! It floats!
VILLAGER #1: Throw her into the pond!
CROWD: The pond!
BEDEMIR: What also floats in water?
VILLAGER #1: Bread!
VILLAGER #2: Apples!
VILLAGER #3: Very small rocks!
VILLAGER #1: Cider!
VILLAGER #2: Great gravy!
VILLAGER #1: Cherries!
VILLAGER #2: Mud!
VILLAGER #3: Churches -- churches!
VILLAGER #2: Lead -- lead!
ARTHUR: A duck.
CROWD: Oooh.
BEDEMIR: Exactly! So, logically...,
VILLAGER #1: If... she.. weighs the same as a duck, she's made of
wood.
BEDEMIR: And therefore--?
VILLAGER #1: A witch!
CROWD: A witch!
BEDEMIR: We shall use my largest scales!
[yelling]
BEDEMIR: Right, remove the supports!
[whop]
[creak]
CROWD: A witch! A witch!
WITCH: It's a fair cop.
CROWD: Burn her! Burn!
[yelling]
BEDEMIR: Who are you who are so wise in the ways of science?
ARTHUR: I am Arthur, King of the Britons.
BEDEMIR: My liege!
ARTHUR: Good Sir knight, will you come with me to Camelot,
and join us at the Round Table?
BEDEMIR: My liege! I would be honored.
ARTHUR: What is your name?
BEDEMIR: Bedemir, my leige.
ARTHUR: Then I dub you Sir Bedemir, Knight of the Round Table.
[Narrative Interlude]
NARRATOR: The wise Sir Bedemir was the first to join King
Arthur's knights, but other illustrious names were soon to follow:
Sir Launcelot the Brave; Sir Galahad the Pure; and Sir Robin the
Not-quite-so-brave-as-Sir-Launcelot who had nearly fought the
Dragon of Agnor, who had nearly stood up to the vicious Chicken of
Bristol and who had personally wet himself at the Battle of Badon
Hill; and the aptly named Sir Not-appearing-in-this-film. Together
they formed a band whose names and deeds were to be retold
throughout the centuries, the Knights of the Round Table.
Scene 6
BEDEMIR: And that, my liege, is how we know the Earth to be
banana-shaped.
ARTHUR: This new learning amazes me, Sir Bedemir. Explain again
how sheeps' bladders may be employed to prevent earthquakes.
BEDEMIR: Oh, certainly, sir.
LAUNCELOT: Look, my liege!
ARTHUR: Camelot!
GALAHAD: Camelot!
LAUNCELOT: Camelot!
PATSY: It's only a model.
ARTHUR: Shhh! Knights, I bid you welcome to your new home. Let
us ride... to Camelot.
[singing]
We're knights of the round table
We dance when e'er we're able
We do routines and parlour scenes
With footwork impecc-Able.
We dine well here in Camelot
We eat ham and jam and spam a lot
[dancing]
We're knights of the Round Table
Our shows are for-mid-able
Oh many times we're given rhymes
That are quite unsing-able
We not so fat in Camelot
We sing from the diaphragm a lot
[tap-dancing]
Oh we're tough and able
Quite indefatigable
Between our quests we [something]
And impersonate Clark Gable
It's a bit too loud in Camelot
I have to push the pram a lot.

ARTHUR: Well, on second thought, let's not go to Camelot -- it is
a silly place. Right.
Scene 7
GOD: Arthur! Arthur, King of the Britons! Oh, don't grovel! If
there's one thing I can't stand, it's people groveling.
ARTHUR: Sorry--
GOD: And don't apologize. Every time I try to talk to someone
it's sorry this and forgive me that and I'm not worthy. What
are you doing now!?
ARTHUR: I'm averting my eyes, oh Lord.
GOD: Well, don't. It's like those miserable Psalms -- they're so
depressing. Now knock it off!
ARTHUR: Yes, Lord.
GOD: Right! Arthur, King of the Britons -- you're Knights of the
Round Table shall have a task to make them an example in these dark
times.
ARTHUR: Good idea, oh Lord!
GOD: 'Course it's a good idea! Behold! Arthur, this is the Holy
Grail. Look well, Arthur, for it is your sacred task to seek
this Grail. That is your purpose, Arthur -- the Quest for the
Holy Grail.
ARTHUR: A blessing!
LAUNCELOT: A blessing from the Lord!
GALAHAD: God be praised!
Scene 8
[clop clop]
ARTHUR: Halt! Hallo! Hallo!
GUARD: 'Allo! Who is zis?
ARTHUR: It is King Arthur, and these are the Knights of the Round
Table. Who's castle is this?
GUARD: This is the castle of my master, Guido Wommer!
ARTHUR: Go and tell your master that we have been charged by God
with a sacred quest. If he will give us food and shelter for
the night he can join us in our quest for the Holy Grail.
GUARD: Well, I'll ask him, but I don't think he'll be very
keen... Uh, he's already got one, you see?
ARTHUR: What?
GALAHAD: He says they've already got one!
ARTHUR: Are you sure he's got one?
GUARD: Oh, yes, it's very nice-a (I told him we already got one)
ARTHUR: Well, um, can we come up and have a look?
GUARD: Of course not! You are English types-a!
ARTHUR: Well, what are you then?
GUARD: I'm French! Why do think I have this outrageous accent,
you silly king!
GALAHAD: What are you doing in England?
GUARD: Mind your own business!
ARTHUR: If you will not show us the Grail, we shall take your
castle by force!
GUARD: You don't frighten us, English pig-dogs! Go and boil your
bottoms, sons of a silly person. I blow my nose at you,
so-called Arthur-king, you and all your silly English kaniggets.
Thppppt!
GALAHAD: What a strange person.
ARTHUR: Now look here, my good man!
GUARD: I don't want to talk to you no more, you empty headed
animal food trough water! I fart in your general direction! You
mother was a hamster and your father smelt of elderberries!
GALAHAD: Is there someone else up there we could talk to?
GUARD: No, now go away or I shall taunt you a second time-a!
ARTHUR: Now, this is your last chance. I've been more than
reasonable.
GUARD: (Fetch-e la vache.) wha?
GUARD: (Fetch-e la vache!)
[moo!]
ARTHUR: If you do not agree to my commands, then I shall--
[twong]
[mooooooo]
Jesus Christ! Right! Charge!
ALL: Charge!
[mayhem]
GUARD: Ah, this one is for your mother!
[twong]
ALL: Run away!
GUARD: Thpppt!
[ after running away...]
LAUNCELOT: Fiends! I'll tear them apart!
ARTHUR: No no, no.
BEDEMIR: Sir! I have a plan, sir.
[later]
[chop]
[rumble rumble squeak]
MUTTERING GUARDS: ce labon a bunny do wha? un codoo?
a present! oh, un codoo. oui oui hurry! wha-? let's
go!
[rumble rumble squeak]
ARTHUR: What happens now?
BEDEMIR: Well, now, uh, Launcelot, Galahad, and I, wait until
nightfall, and then leap out of the rabbit, taking the French by
surprise -- not only by surprise, but totally unarmed!
ARTHUR: Who leaps out?
BEDEMIR: Uh, Launcelot, Galahad, and I. Uh, leap out of the
rabbit, uh and uh....
ARTHUR: Oh....
BEDEMIR: Oh.... Um, l-look, if we built this large wooden
badger--
[twong]
ALL: Run away! Run away! Run away! Run away!
[splat]
GUARDS: Oh, haw haw haw.
Scene 9
Pictures for Schools, take 8.
DIRECTOR: Action!
NARRATOR: Defeat at the castle seems to have utterly disheartened
King Arthur. The ferocity of the French taunting took him
completely by surprise, and Arthur became convinced that a new
strategy was required if the quest for the Holy Grail were to be
brought to a successful conclusion. Arthur, having consulted his
closest knights, decided that they should separate, and search for
the Grail individually. Now, this is what they did--
[clop clop]
[An unknown knight rides in and stabs the narrator]
WOMAN: Greg!
Scene 10
NARRATOR: The Tale of Sir Robin.... So each of the knights
went their separate ways. Sir Robin rode north, through the dark
forest of Ewing, accompanied by his favorite minstrels.
MINSTREL (singing):
Bravely bold Sir Robin, rode forth from Camelot.
He was not afraid to die, o Brave Sir Robin.
He was not at all afraid to be killed in nasty ways.
Brave, brave, brave, brave Sir Robin!
He was not in the least bit scared to be mashed into a pulp,
Or to have his eyes gouged out, and his elbows broken.
To have his kneecaps split, and his body burned away,
And his limbs all hacked and mangled, brave Sir Robin!
His head smashed in and his heart cut out,
And his liver removed and his bowels unplugged,
And his nostrils ripped and his bottom burned off,
And his balls...
ROBIN: That's -- that's, uh, that's enough music for now, lads.
Looks like there's dirty work afoot.
DENNIS: Anarcho-syndicalism is a way of preserving freedom.
WOMAN: Oh, Dennis, forget about freedom. Now I've dropped my
mud.
ALL HEADS: Halt! Who art thou?
MINSTREL (singing): He is brave Sir Robin, brave Sir Robin, who--
ROBIN: Shut up! Um, n-n-nobody really, I'm j-just um, just
passing through.
ALL HEADS: What do you want?
MINSTREL (singing): To fight, and--
ROBIN: Shut up! Um, oo, n-nothing, nothing really -- I, uh,
j-j-ust to um, just to p-pass through good Sir knight.
ALL HEADS: I'm afraid not!
ROBIN: Ah. W-well, actually I am a Knight of the Round Table.
ALL HEADS: You're a Knight of the Round Table?
ROBIN: I am.
LEFT HEAD: In that case I shall have to kill you.
MIDDLE HEAD: Shall I?
RIGHT HEAD: Oh, I don't think so.
MIDDLE HEAD: Well, what do I think?
LEFT HEAD: I think kill him.
RIGHT HEAD: Well let's be nice to him.
MIDDLE HEAD: Oh shut up.
LEFT HEAD: Perhaps-
MIDDLE HEAD: And you.
LEFT HEAD: Oh quick get the sword out I want to cut his head off!
RIGHT HEAD: Oh, cut your own head off!
MIDDLE HEAD: Yes, do us all a favor!
LEFT HEAD: What?
RIGHT HEAD: Yapping on all the time.
MIDDLE HEAD: You're lucky, you're not next to him.
LEFT HEAD: What do you mean?
MIDDLE HEAD: You snore.
LEFT HEAD: Oh I don't -- anyway, you've got bad breath.
MIDDLE HEAD: Well its only because you don't brush my teeth.
RIGHT HEAD: Oh stop bitching and let's go have tea.
LEFT HEAD: All right all right all right we'll kill him first
and then have tea and biscuits.
MIDDLE HEAD: Yes.
RIGHT HEAD: Oh, but not biscuits.
LEFT HEAD: All right all right not biscuits, but lets kill him
anyway.
ALL HEADS: Right!
LEFT HEAD: He buggered off.
RIGHT HEAD: So he has, he's scarpered.
MINSTREL (singing): Brave Sir Robin ran away
ROBIN: No!
MINSTREL (singing): Bravely ran away away
ROBIN: I didn't!
MINSTREL (singing): When danger reared its ugly head,
He bravely turned his tail and fled
ROBIN: No!
MINSTREL (singing): Yes Brave Sir Robin turned about
ROBIN: I didn't!
MINSTREL (singing): And gallantly he chickened out
Bravely taking to his feet
ROBIN: I never did!
MINSTREL (singing): He beat a very brave retreat
ROBIN: Oh, lie!
MINSTREL (singing): Bravest of the brave Sir Robin
ROBIN: I never!
Scene 11
NARRATOR: The Tale of Sir Galahad
[boom crash]
[angels singing]
[pound pound pound]
GALAHAD: Open the door! Open the door!
[pound pound pound]
In the name of King Arthur, open the door!
[squeak thump]
[squeak boom]
ALL: Hello!
ZOOT: Welcome gentle Sir knight, welcome to the Castle Anthrax.
GALAHAD: The Castle Anthrax?
ZOOT: Yes... oh, it's not a very good name is it? Oh! but we are
nice and we shall attend to your every, every need!
GALAHAD: You are the keepers of the Holy Grail?
ZOOT: The what?
GALAHAD: The Grail -- it is here?
ZOOT: Oh, but you are tired, and you must rest awhile. Midget!
Crepper!
MIDGET and CREPPER: Yes, oh Zoot!
ZOOT: Prepare a bed for our guest.
MIDGET and CREPPER: Oh thank you thank you thank you--
ZOOT: Away away vile peasents! The beds here are warm and soft
- -- and very, very big.
GALAHAD: Well, look, I-I-uh--
ZOOT: What is your name, handsome knight?
GALAHAD: Sir Galahad... the Chaste.
ZOOT: Mine is Zoot... just Zoot. Oh, but come!
GALAHAD: Look, please! In God's name, show me the Grail!
ZOOT: Oh, you have suffered much! You are delirious!
GALAHAD: L-look, I have seen it! It is here, in the--
ZOOT: Sir Galahad! You would not be so ungallant as to refuse
our hospitality.
GALAHAD: Well, I-I-uh--
ZOOT: Oh, I am afraid our life must seem very dull and quiet
compared to yours. We are but eight score young blondes and
brunettes, all between sixteen and nineteen and a half, cut off in
this castle with no one to protect us! Oh, it is a lonely life --
bathing, dressing, undressing, making exciting underwear.... We
are just not used to handsome knights. Nay, nay, come, come, you
may lie here. Oh, but you are wounded!
GALAHAD: No, no -- i-it's nothing!
ZOOT: Oh, but you must see the doctors immediately! No, no,
please, lie down.
[clap clap]
PIGLET: Ah. What seems to be the trouble?
GALAHAD: They're doctors?!
ZOOT: Uh, they've had a basic medical training, yes.
GALAHAD: B-but--
ZOOT: Oh, come come, you must try to rest! Doctor Piglet,
Doctor Winston, practice your art.
PIGLET: Try to relax.
GALAHAD: Are you sure that's necessary?
PIGLET: We must examine you.
GALAHAD: There's nothing wrong with that!
PIGLET: Please -- we are doctors.
GALAHAD: Get off the bed! I am sworn to chastity!
PIGLET: Back to your bed!
GALAHAD: Torment me no longer! I have seen the Grail!
PIGLET: There's no grail here.
GALAHAD: I have seen it, I have seen it. I have seen--
GIRLS: Hello.
GALAHAD: Oh--
VARIOUS GIRLS: Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello.
Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello.
Hello.
GALAHAD: Zoot!
DINGO: No, I am Zoot's identical twin sister, Dingo.
GALAHAD: Oh, well, excuse me, I--
DINGO: Where are you going?
GALAHAD: I seek the Grail! I have seen it, here in this castle!
DINGO: No! Oh, no! Bad, bad Zoot!
GALAHAD: What is it?
DINGO: Oh, wicked, bad, naughty Zoot! She has been setting
alight to our beacon, which, I just remembered, is grail-shaped.
It's not the first time we've had this problem.
GALAHAD: It's not the real Grail?
DINGO: Oh, wicked, bad, naughty, evil Zoot! Oh, she is a naughty
person, and she must pay the penalty -- and here in Castle
Anthrax, we have but one punishment for setting alight the
grail-shaped beacon. You must tie her down on a bed and spank her!
GIRLS: A spanking! A spanking!
DINGO: You must spank her well. And after you have spanked her,
you may deal with her as you like. And then, spank me.
VARIOUS GIRLS: And spank me. And me. And me.
DINGO: Yes, yes, you must give us all a good spanking!
GIRLS: A spanking! A spanking!
DINGO: And after the spanking, the oral sex.
GIRLS: Oral sex! Oral sex!
GALAHAD: Well, I could stay a BIT longer.
LAUNCELOT: Sir Galahad!
GALAHAD: Oh, hello.
LAUNCELOT: Quick!
GALAHAD: What?
LAUNCELOT: Quick!
GALAHAD: Why?
LAUNCELOT: You're in great peril!
GALAHAD:
ZOOT:
LAUNCELOT: Silence, foul temptress!
GALAHAD: Now look, it's not important.
LAUNCELOT: Quick! Come on and we'll cover your escape!
GALAHAD: Look, I'm fine!
LAUNCELOT: Come on!
GALAHAD: Now look, I can tackle this lot single-handed!
DINGO: Yes! Let him tackle us single-handed!
GIRLS: Yes! Tackle us single-handed!
LAUNCELOT: No, Sir Galahad, come on!
GALAHAD: No, really, honestly, I can go back and handle this lot
easily!
DINGO: Oh, yes, let him handle us easily.
GIRLS: Yes, yes!
GALAHAD: Wait! I can defeat them! There's only a hundred and
fifty of them!
DINGO: Yes, yes, he'll beat us easily, we haven't a chance.
GIRLS: Yes, yes.
[boom]
DINGO: Oh, shit.
[outside]
LAUNCELOT: We were in the nick of time, you were in great peril.

GALAHAD: I don't think I was.
LAUNCELOT: Yes you were, you were in terrible peril.
GALAHAD: Look, let me go back in there and face the peril.
LAUNCELOT: No, it's too perilous.
GALAHAD: Look, [something] as much peril as I can.
LAUNCELOT: No, we've got to find the Holy Grail. Come on!
GALAHAD: Well, let me have just a little bit of peril?
LAUNCELOT: No, it's unhealthy.
GALAHAD: Bet you're gay!
LAUNCELOT: No, I'm not.
Narrative Interlude
NARRATOR: Sir Launcelot had saved Sir Galahad from almost certain
temptation, but they were still no nearer the Grail. Meanwhile,
King Arthur and Sir Bedemir, not more than a swallow's flight
away, had discovered something. Oh, that's an unladen swallow's
flight, obviously. I mean, they were more than two laden swallow's
flights away -- four, really, if they hadn't a cord of line between
them. I mean, if the birds were walking and dragging--
CROWD: Get on with it!
NARRATOR: Oh, anyway, on to scene twenty-four, which is a
smashing scene with some lovely acting, in which Arthur discovers
a vital clue, in which there aren't any swallows, although I think
you can hear a starling -oolp!
Scene 12
OLD MAN: Ah, hee he he ha!
ARTHUR: And this enchanter of whom you speak, he has seen the
grail?
OLD MAN: Ha ha he he he he!
ARTHUR: Where does he live? Old man, where does he live?
OLD MAN: He knows of a cave, a cave which no man has entered.
ARTHUR: And the Grail... The Grail is there?
OLD MAN: Very much danger, for beyond the cave lies the Gorge
of Eternal Peril, which no man has ever crossed.
ARTHUR: But the Grail! Where is the Grail!?
OLD MAN: Seek you the Bridge of Death.
ARTHUR: The Bridge of Death, which leads to the Grail?
OLD MAN: Hee hee ha ha!
Scene 13
HEAD KNIGHT: Nee! Nee! Nee! Nee!
ARTHUR: Who are you?
HEAD KNIGHT: We are the Knights Who Say... Nee!
ARTHUR: No! Not the Knights Who Say Nee!
HEAD KNIGHT: The same!
BEDEMIR: Who are they?
HEAD KNIGHT: We are the keepers of the sacred words: Nee, Pang,
and Nee-wom!
RANDOM: Nee-wom!
ARTHUR: Those who hear them seldom live to tell the tale!
HEAD KNIGHT: The Knights Who Say Nee demand a sacrifice!
ARTHUR: Knights of Nee, we are but simple travellers who seek the
enchanter who lives beyond these woods.
HEAD KNIGHT: Nee! Nee! Nee! Nee!
ARTHUR and PARTY: Oh, ow!
HEAD KNIGHT: We shall say 'nee' again to you if you do not
appease us.
ARTHUR: Well, what is it you want?
HEAD KNIGHT: We want... a shrubbery!
[dramatic chord]
ARTHUR: A what?
HEAD KNIGHT: Nee! Nee!
ARTHUR and PARTY: Oh, ow!
ARTHUR: Please, please! No more! We shall find a shrubbery.
HEAD KNIGHT: You must return here with a shrubbery or else you
will never pass through this wood alive!
ARTHUR: O Knights of Nee, you are just and fair, and we will
return with a shrubbery.
HEAD KNIGHT: One that looks nice.
ARTHUR: Of course.
HEAD KNIGHT: And not too expensive.
ARTHUR: Yes.
HEAD KNIGHTS: Now... go!
Scene 14
NARRATOR: The Tale of Sir Launcelot.
FATHER: One day, lad, all this will be yours!
HERBERT: What, the curtains?
FATHER: No, not the curtains, lad. All that you can see!
Stretched out over the hills and valleys of this land! This'll be
your kingdom, lad!
HERBERT: But, Mother--
FATHER: Father, I'm Father.
HERBERT: But Father, I don't want any of that.
FATHER: Listen, lad. I've built this kingdom up from nothing.
When I started here, all there was was swamp. The king said I was
daft to build a castle in a swamp, but I built it all the same,
just to show 'em. It sank into the swamp. So, I built a second
one. That sank into the swamp. So I built a third one. That
burned down, fell over, then sank into the swamp. But the fourth
one stayed up. An' that's what your gonna get, lad -- the strongest
castle in these islands.
HERBERT: But I don't want any of that -- I'd rather--
FATHER: Rather what?!
HERBERT: I'd rather... just... [music] ...sing!
FATHER: Stop that, stop that! You're not going to do a song
while I'm here. Now listen lad, in twenty minutes you're getting
married to a girl whose father owns the biggest tracts of open land
in Britain.
HERBERT: But I don't want land.
FATHER: Listen, Alice...
HERBERT: Herbert.
FATHER: Herbert. We live in a bloody swamp. We need all the
land we can get.
HERBERT: But I don't like her.
FATHER: Don't like her?! What's wrong with her? She's
beautiful, she's rich, she's got huge... tracts of land.
HERBERT: I know, but I want the girl that I marry to have...
a certain... special... [music] ...something...
FATHER: Cut that out, cut that out. Look, you're marryin'
Princess Looky, so you'd better get used to the idea. [smack]
Guards! Make sure the Prince doesn't leave this room until I come
and get 'im.
GUARD #1: Not to leave the room even if you come and get him.
GUARD #2: Hic!
FATHER: No, no. Until I come and get 'im.
GUARD #1: Until you come and get him, we're not to enter the
room.
FATHER: No, no, no. You stay in the room and make sure 'e
doesn't leave.
GUARD #1: And you'll come and get him.
GUARD #2: Hic!
FATHER: Right.
GUARD #1: We don't need to do anything, apart from just stop him
entering the room.
FATHER: No, no. Leaving the room.
GUARD #1: Leaving the room, yes.
FATHER: All right?
GUARD #1: Right. Oh, if-if-if, uh, if-if-if, uh, if-if-if we...
FATHER: Yes, what is it?
GUARD #1: Oh, if-if, oh--
FATHER: Look, it's quite simple.
GUARD #1: Uh...
FATHER: You just stay here, and make sure 'e doesn't leave the
room. All right?
GUARD #2: Hic!
FATHER: Right.
GUARD #1: Oh, I remember. Uh, can he leave the room with us?
FATHER: N- No no no. You just keep him in here, and make sure--
GUARD #1: Oh, yes, we'll keep him in here, obviously. But if he
had to leave and we were--
FATHER: No, no, just keep him in here--
GUARD #1: Until you, or anyone else,--
FATHER: No, not anyone else, just me--
GUARD #1: Just you.
GUARD #2: Hic!
FATHER: Get back.
GUARD #1: Get back.
FATHER: Right?
GUARD #1: Right, we'll stay here until you get back.
FATHER: And, uh, make sure he doesn't leave.
GUARD #1: What?
FATHER: Make sure 'e doesn't leave.
GUARD #1: The Prince?
FATHER: Yes, make sure 'e doesn't leave.
GUARD #1: Oh, yes, of course. I thought you meant him. Y'know,
it seemed a bit daft, me havin' to guard him when he's a guard.
FATHER: Is that clear?
GUARD #2: Hic!
GUARD #1: Oh, quite clear, no problems.
FATHER: Right.
[starts to leave]
Where are you going?
GUARD #1: We're coming with you.
FATHER: No no, I want you to stay 'ere and make sure 'e doesn't
leave.
GUARD #1: Oh, I see. Right.
HERBERT: But, Father!
FATHER: Shut your noise, you! And get that suit on! And no
singing!
GUARD #2: Hic!
FATHER: Oh, go get a glass of water.

LAUNCELOT: Well taken, Concorde!
CONCORDE: Thank you, sir! Most kind.
LAUNCELOT: And again... Over we go! Good. Steady! And now, the
big one...Ooof! Come on, Concorde!
[thwonk]
CONCORDE: Message for you, sir.
[fwump]
LAUNCELOT: Concorde! Concorde, speak to me! To whoever finds
this note, I have been imprisoned by my father, who wishes me to
marry against my will. Please, please, please come and rescue me.
I am in the tall tower of Swamp Castle. At last! A call, a cry
of distress! This could be the sign that leads us to the Holy
Grail! Brave, brave Concorde! You shall not have died in vain!
CONCORDE: Uh, I'm-I'm not quite dead, sir.
LAUNCELOT: Well, you shall not have been mortally wounded in
vain!
CONCORDE: Uh, I-I think uh, I could pull through, sir.
LAUNCELOT: Oh, I see.
CONCORDE: Actually, I think I'm all right to come with you--
LAUNCELOT: No, no, sweet Concorde! Stay here! I will send help
as soon as I have accomplished a daring and heroic rescue in my own
particular... (sigh)
CONCORDE: Idiom, sir?
LAUNCELOT: Idiom!
CONCORDE: No, I feel fine, actually, sir.
LAUNCELOT: Farewell, sweet Concorde!
CONCORDE: I'll-uh, I'll just stay here, then, shall I, sir? Yeah.
Scene 16
LAUNCELOT: Ha-ha! etc.
GUARD #1: Now, you're not allowed to come in here, and we're-ugh!
LAUNCELOT: O fair one, behold your humble servant Sir Launcelot
of Camelot. I have come to take -- oh, I'm terribly sorry.
HERBERT: You got my note!
LAUNCELOT: Uh, well, I got A note.
HERBERT: You've come to rescue me!
LAUNCELOT: Uh, well, no, you see--
HERBERT: I knew that someone would, I knew that somewhere out
there... there must be... [music] ...someone...
FATHER: Stop that, stop that, stop it! Stop it! Who are you?
HERBERT: I'm your son!
FATHER: No, not you.
LAUNCELOT: I'm Sir Launcelot, sir.
HERBERT: He's come to rescue me, father.
LAUNCELOT: Well, let's not jump to conclusions.
FATHER: Did you kill all the guard?
LAUNCELOT: Uh..., oh, yes. Sorry.
FATHER: They cost fifty pounds each.
LAUNCELOT: Well, I'm awfully sorry, I'm -- I really can explain
everything.
HERBERT: Don't be afraid of him, Sir Launcelot, I've got a rope
all ready!
FATHER: You killed eight wedding guests in all!
LAUNCELOT: Well, you see, the thing is, I thought your son was a
lady.
FATHER: I can understand that.
HERBERT: Hurry, Sir Launcelot! Hurry!
FATHER: Shut up! You only killed the bride's father, that's all!
LAUNCELOT: Well, I really didn't mean to...
FATHER: Didn't mean to?! You put your sword right through his
head!
LAUNCELOT: Oh, dear. Is he all right?
FATHER: You even kicked the bride in the chest! This is going to
cost me a fortune!
LAUNCELOT: Well, I can explain. I was in the forest, um, riding
north from Camelot, when I got this note, you see--
FATHER: Camelot? Are you from, uh, Camelot?
HERBERT: Hurry, Sir Launcelot!
LAUNCELOT: Uh, I am a Knight of King Arthur, sir.
FATHER: Pretty nice castle, Camelot. Uh, pretty good pig
country....
LAUNCELOT: Yes.
HERBERT: Hurry, I'm ready!
FATHER: Would you, uh, like to come and have a drink?
LAUNCELOT: Well, that's, uh, awfully nice of you.
HERBERT: I am ready!
[start to leave]
LAUNCELOT: --I mean to be, so understanding.
[thonk]
HERBERT: Oooh!
LAUNCELOT: Um, I think when I'm in this idiom, I sometimes get a
bit, uh, sort of carried away.
FATHER: Oh, don't worry about that.
HERBERT: Oooh!

Scene 17
[wailing]
FATHER: Well, this is the main hall. We're going to have all
this knocked through, and made into one big, uh, living room.
RANDOM: There he is!
FATHER: Oh, bloody hell.
LAUNCELOT: Ha-ha! etc.
FATHER: Hold it, hold it! Please!
LAUNCELOT: Sorry, sorry. See what I mean, I just get carried
away. I really must -- sorry, sorry! Sorry, everyone.
RANDOM: He's killed the best man!
[yelling]
FATHER: Hold it, please! Hold it! This is Sir Launcelot from
the gorge of Camelot -- a very brave and influential knight, and my
special guest here today.
LAUNCELOT: Hello.
RANDOM: He killed my auntie!
[yelling]
FATHER: Please, please! This is supposed to be a happy occasion!
Let's not bicker and argue about who killed who. We are here
today to witness the union of two young people in the joyful bond
of the holy wedlock. Unfortunately, one of them, my son Herbert,
has just fallen to his death. But I think I've not lost a son, so
much as... gained a daughter! For, since the tragic death of her
father--
RANDOM: He's not quite dead!
FATHER: Since the near fatal wounding of her father--
RANDOM: He's getting better!
FATHER: For, since her own father... who, when he seemed about to
recover, suddenly felt the icy hand of death upon him,--
[ugh]
RANDOM: Oh, he's died!
FATHER: And I want his only daughter to look upon me... as her
own dad -- in a very real, and legally binding sense.
[clapping]
And I feel sure that the merger -- uh, the union -- between
the Princess and the brave, but dangerous, Sir Launcelot of
Camelot--
LAUNCELOT: What?
RANDOM: Look! The dead Prince!
CONCORDE: He's not quite dead!
HERBERT: Oh, I feel much better.
FATHER: You fell out of the cold tower, you creep!
HERBERT: No, I was saved at the last minute.
FATHER: How?!
HERBERT: Well, I'll tell you... [music]
FATHER: Not like that! Not like that! No, stop it!
SINGING: He's going to tell! He's going to tell!
FATHER: Shut up!
SINGING: He's going to tell! He's going to tell!
He's going to tell! He's going to tell!
He's going to tell! He's going to tell!
He's going to tell! He's going to tell!
CONCORDE: Quickly, sir! This way!
LAUNCELOT: No, it's not in my idiom! I must escape in my own
particular....(sigh)
CONCORDE: Dogma, sir?
LAUNCELOT: Dogma! Hee! Ha!
[crash]
Excuse me, could, uh, could somebody give me a push,
please...?
Scene 18
[clop clop]
ARTHUR: Old crone! Is there anywhere in this town where we could
buy a shrubbery!
[dramatic chord]
CRONE: Who sent you?
ARTHUR: The Knights Who Say Nee.
CRONE: Agh! No! Never! We have no shrubberies here.
ARTHUR: If you do not tell us where we can buy a shrubbery, my
friend and I will say... we will say... `nee'.
CRONE: Agh! Do your worst!
ARTHUR: Very well! If you will not assist us voluntarily,...
nee!
CRONE: No! Never! No shrubberies!
ARTHUR: Nee!
BEDEMIR: Noo! Noo!
ARTHUR: No, no, no, no -- it's not that, it's 'nee'.
BEDEMIR: Noo!
ARTHUR: No, no -- 'nee'. You're not doing it properly.
BEDEMIR: Noo! Nee!
ARTHUR: That's it, that's it, you've got it.
ARTHUR and BEDEMIR: Nee! Nee!
ROGER: Are you saying 'nee' to that old woman?
ARTHUR: Um, yes.
ROGER: Oh, what sad times are these when passing ruffians can
`nee' at will to old ladies. There is a pestilence upon this land,
nothing is sacred. Even those who arrange and design shrubberies
are under considerable economic stress at this period in history.
ARTHUR: Did you say `shrubberies'?
ROGER: Yes, shrubberies are my trade -- I am a shrubber. My name
is Roger the Shrubber. I arrange, design, and sell shrubberies.
BEDEMIR: Nee!
ARTHUR: No! No, no, no! No!
Scene 19
ARTHUR: O, Knights of Nee, we have brought you your shrubbery.
May we go now?
HEAD KNIGHT: It is a good shrubbery. I like the laurels
particularly. But there is one small problem.
ARTHUR: What is that?
HEAD KNIGHT: We are now... no longer the Knights Who Say Nee.
RANDOM: Nee!
HEAD KNIGHT: Shh shh. We are now the Knights Who Say
Ecky-ecky-ecky-ecky-pikang-zoom-boing-mumble-mumble.
RANDOM: Nee!
HEAD KNIGHT: Therefore, we must give you a test.
ARTHUR: What is this test, O Knights of-- Knights Who 'Til
Recently Said Nee?
HEAD KNIGHT: Firstly, you must find... another shrubbery!
[dramatic chord]
ARTHUR: Not another shrubbery!
HEAD KNIGHT: Then, when you have found the shrubbery, you must
place it here beside this shrubbery, only slightly higher so you
get a two-level effect with a little path running down the middle.
RANDOM: A path! A path! Nee!
HEAD KNIGHT: Then, when you have found the shrubbery, you must
cut down the mightiest tree in the forest... with... a herring!
[dramatic chord]
ARTHUR: We shall do no such thing!
HEAD KNIGHT: Oh, please!
ARTHUR: Cut down a tree with a herring? It can't be done.
KNIGHTS: Aaaaugh! Aaaugh!
HEAD KNIGHT: Don't say that word.
ARTHUR: What word?
HEAD KNIGHT: I cannot tell, suffice to say is one of the words
the Knights of Nee cannot hear.
ARTHUR: How can we not say the word if you don't tell us what it
is?
KNIGHTS: Aaaaugh! Aaaugh!
ARTHUR: What, `is'?
HEAD KNIGHT: No, not `is' -- we couldn't get vary far in life not
saying `is'.
BEDEMIR: My liege, it's Sir Robin!
MINSTREL (singing): Packing it in and packing it up
And sneaking away and buggering up
And chickening out and pissing about
Yes, bravely he is throwing in the sponge
ARTHUR: Oh, Robin! ROBIN: My liege! It's good to see you!
KNIGHTS: Aaaaugh!
HEAD KNIGHT: He said the word!
ARTHUR: Surely you've not given up your quest for the Holy Grail?
MINSTREL (singing): He is sneaking away and buggering up--
ROBIN: Shut up! No, no no-- far from it.
HEAD KNIGHT: He said the word again!
ROBIN: I was looking for it.
KNIGHTS: Aaaaugh!
ROBIN: Uh, here, here in this forest.
ARTHUR: No, it is far from--
KNIGHTS: Aaaaugh!
HEAD KNIGHT: Aaaaugh! Stop saying the word!
ARTHUR: Oh, stop it!
KNIGHTS: Aaaaugh!
HEAD KNIGHT: Oh! He said it again!
ARTHUR: Patsy!
HEAD KNIGHT: Aaugh! I said it! I said it! Ooh! I said it
again!
KNIGHTS: Aaaaugh!
Narrative Interlude
NARRATOR: And so Arthur and Bedemir and Sir Robin set out on
their search to find the enchanter of whom the old man had spoken
in Scene 24. Beyond the forest they met Launcelot and Galahad,
and there was much rejoicing.
ALL: Yay! Yay!
NARRATOR: In the frozen land of Nador they were forced to eat
Robin's minstrels. And there was much rejoicing.
ALL: Yay!
NARRATOR: A year passed. Winter changed into Spring. Spring
changed into Summer. Summer changed back into Winter. And Winter
gave Spring and Summer a miss and went straight on into Autumn.
Until one day...
Scene 20
ARTHUR: Knights! Forward!
[boom boom boom boom BOOM boom boom boom boom]
What manner of man are you that can summon up fire without
flint or tinder?
TIM: I... am an enchanter.
ARTHUR: By what name are you known?
TIM: There are some who call me... Tim?
ARTHUR: Greetings, Tim the Enchanter.
TIM: Greetings, King Arthur!
ARTHUR: You know my name?
TIM: I do.
[zoosh]
You seek the Holy Grail!
ARTHUR: That is our quest. You know much that is hidden, O Tim.
TIM: Quite.
[pweeng boom]
[clap clap clap]
ARTHUR: Yes, we're, we're looking for the Grail. Our quest is to
find the Holy Grail.
KNIGHTS: It is, yes, yup, yes, yeah.
ARTHUR: And so we're, we're, we're, we're looking for it.
KNIGHTS: Yes we are we are.
BEDEMIR: We have been for some time.
ROBIN: Ages.
ARTHUR: Uh, so, uh, anything you can do to, uh, to help, would
be... very... helpful...
GALAHAD: Look, can you tell us wh-

ARTHUR: Fine, um, I don't want to waste anymore of your time,
but, uh I don't suppose you could, uh, tell us where we might find
a, um, find a, uh, a, um, a uh--
TIM: A what...?
ARTHUR: A g--, a g--
TIM: A Grail?!
ARTHUR: Yes, I think so.
KNIGHTS: Yes, that's it. Yes.
TIM: Yes!
KNIGHTS: Oh, thank you, splendid, fine.
[boom pweeng boom boom]
ARTHUR: Look, you're a busy man, uh--
TIM: Yes, I can help you find the Holy Grail.
KNIGHTS: Oh, thank you.
TIM: To the north there lies a cave -- the cave of Kyre Banorg --
wherein, carved in mystic runes upon the very living rock, the
last words of Ulfin Bedweer of Regett [boom] proclaim the last
resting place of the most Holy Grail.
ARTHUR: Where could we find this cave, O Tim?
TIM: Follow! But! follow only if ye be men of valor, for the
entrance to this cave is guarded by a creature so foul, so cruel
that no man yet has fought with it and lived! Bones of four fifty
men lie strewn about its lair. So, brave knights, if you do doubt
your courage or your strength, come no further, for death awaits
you all with nasty big pointy teeth.
ARTHUR: What an eccentric performance.
Scene 21
[clop clop whinny]
???: They're nervous, sire.
ARTHUR: Then we'd best leave them here and carry on on foot.
Dis-mount!
TIM: Behold the cave of Kyre Banorg!
ARTHUR: Right! Keep me covered.
???: What with?
ARTHUR: Just keep me covered.
TIM: Too late!
[chord]
ARTHUR: What?
TIM: There he is!
ARTHUR: Where?
TIM: There!
ARTHUR: What, behind the rabbit?
TIM: It is the rabbit!
ARTHUR: You silly sod! You got us all worked up!
TIM: Well, that's no ordinary rabbit. That's the most foul,
cruel, and bad-tempered rodent you ever set eyes on.
ROBIN: You tit! I soiled my armor I was so scared!
TIM: Look, that rabbit's got a vicious streak a mile wide, it's
a killer!
???: Get stuffed!
TIM: It'll do you a trick, mate!
???: Oh, yeah?
ROBIN: You monkey's scot's get!
TIM: I'm warning you!
ROBIN: What's he do, nibble your bum?
TIM: He's got huge, sharp-- he can leap about-- look at the
bones!

BORIS: Right! Silly little bleeder. One rabbit stew comin'
right up!
TIM: Look!

BORIS: Aaaugh!

ARTHUR: Jesus Christ!
TIM: I warned you!
ROBIN: I peed again!
TIM: I warned you! But did you listen to me? Oh, no, you knew
it all, didn't you? Oh, it's just a harmless little bunny, isn't
it? Well, it's always the same, I always--
ARTHUR: Oh, shut up!
TIM: --But do they listen to me?--
ARTHUR: Right!
TIM: -Oh, no--
KNIGHTS: Charge!

KNIGHTS: Aaaaugh! Aaaugh! etc.
KNIGHTS: Run away! Run away!
TIM: Haw haw haw. Haw haw haw. Haw haw.
ARTHUR: Right. How many did we lose?
???: Gawain.
???: Hector.
ARTHUR: And Boris. That's five.
GALAHAD: Three, sir.
ARTHUR: Three. Three. And we'd better not risk another frontal
assault, that rabbit's dynamite.
ROBIN: Would it help to confuse it if we run away more?
ARTHUR: Oh, shut up and go and change your armor.
GALAHAD: Let us taunt it! It may become so cross that it will
make a mistake.
ARTHUR: Like what?
GALAHAD: Well,....
ARTHUR: Have we got bows?
???: No.
LAUNCELOT: We have the Holy Hand Grenade.
ARTHUR: Yes, of course! The Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch! 'Tis
one of the sacred relics Brother Maynard carries with him! Brother
Maynard! Bring up the Holy Hand Grenade!
[singing]
How does it, uh... how does it work?
???: I know not, my liege.
???: Consult the Book of Armaments!
MAYNARD: Armaments, Chapter Two, Verses Nine to Twenty-One.
BROTHER: And Saint Atila raised the hand grenade up on high,
saying, 'Oh, Lord, bless this thy hand grenade that with it thou
mayest blow thy enemies to tiny bits, in thy mercy.' And the Lord
did grin, and people did feast upon the lambs, and sloths, and
carp, and anchovies, and orangutans, and breakfast cereals, and
fruit bats, and large --
MAYNARD: Skip a bit, Brother.
BROTHER: And the Lord spake, saying, 'First shalt thou take out
the Holy Pin. Then, shalt thou count to three, no more, no less.
Three shalt be the number thou shalt count, and the number of the
counting shalt be three. Four shalt thou not count, nor either
count thou two, excepting that thou then proceed to three. Five is
right out. Once the number three, being the third number, be
reached, then lobbest thou thy Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch towards
thou foe, who being naughty in my sight, shall snuff it.'
MAYNARD: Amen.
ALL: Amen.
ARTHUR: Right! One... two... five!
???: Three, sir!
ARTHUR: Three!
[boom]
Scene 22
???: There! Look!
LAUNCELOT: What does it say?
GALAHAD: What language is that?
ARTHUR: Brother Maynard, you're our scholar!
MAYNARD: It's Aramaic!
GALAHAD: Of course! Joseph of Aramathea!
LAUNCELOT: Course!
???: What does it say?
MAYNARD: It reads, 'Here may be found the last words of Joseph of
Aramathea. He who is valiant and pure of spirit may find the
Holy Grail in the Castle of uuggggggh'.
ARTHUR: What?
MAYNARD: '... the Castle of uuggggggh'.
BEDEMIR: What is that?
MAYNARD: He must have died while carving it.
LAUNCELOT: Oh, come on!
MAYNARD: Well, that's what it says.
ARTHUR: Look, if he was dying, he wouldn't bother to carve
'aaggggh'. He'd just say it!
MAYNARD: Well, that's what's carved in the rock!
GALAHAD: Perhaps he was dictating.
ARTHUR: Oh, shut up. Well, does it say anything else?
MAYNARD: No. Just, 'uuggggggh'.
LAUNCELOT: Aauuggghhh.
???: Aaauggh.
BEDEMIR: You don't suppose he meant the Camauuuugh?
???: Where's that?
BEDEMIR: France, I think.
LAUNCELOT: Isn't there a Saint Aauuuves in Cornwall?
ARTHUR: No, that's Saint Ives.
LAUNCELOT: Oh, yes. Saint Iiiives.
SEVERAL: Iiiiives.
BEDEMIR: Oooohoohohooo!
LAUNCELOT: No, no, aauuuuugh, at the back of the throat.
Aauuugh.
BEDEMIR: No, no, no, oooooooh, in surprise and alarm.
LAUNCELOT: Oh, you mean sort of a aaaagh!
BEDEMIR: Yes, but I-- Aaaaagh!
???: Oooh!
???: Oh, no!
[roar]
MAYNARD: It's the legendary Black Beast of aaauuugh!
ARTHUR: Run away!
ALL: Run away! Run away!
[roar]
NARRATOR: As the horrendous Black Beast lunged forward, escape
for Arthur and his knights seemed hopeless. When, suddenly, the
animator suffered a fatal heart attack. [ulk] The cartoon
peril was no more. The Quest for Holy Grail could continue.
Scene 23
ARTHUR: There it is! The Bridge of Death!
ROBIN: Oh, great.
???: Look!
ARTHUR: There's the old man from Scene 24!
BEDEMIR: What is he doing here?
ARTHUR: He is the keeper of the Bridge of Death. He asks each
traveller five questions--
???: Three questions.
ARTHUR: Three questions. He who answers the five questions--
???: Three questions.
ARTHUR: Three questions may cross in safety.
ROBIN: What if you get a question wrong?
ARTHUR: Then you are cast into the Gorge of Eternal Peril.
ROBIN: Oh, I won't go.
???: Who's going to answer the questions?
ARTHUR: Sir Robin!
ROBIN: Yes?
ARTHUR: Brave Sir Robin, you go.
ROBIN: Hey! I've got a great idea. Why doesn't Launcelot go?
LAUNCELOT: Yes, let me go, my liege. I will take him
single-handed. I shall make a feint to the north-east--
ARTHUR: No, no, hang on hang on hang on! Just answer the five
questions--
???: Three questions.
ARTHUR: Three questions as best you can. And we shall watch...
and pray.
LAUNCELOT: I understand, my liege.
ARTHUR: Good luck, brave Sir Launcelot. God be with you.

I can see the reality

You find your world is tumbling down

Until love took a detour
Yeah, riding high on top of the world
It happened, suddenly it just happened
I saw my dreams fall apart
When love walked away from my heart
And when you lose that precious love you need
To guide you
Something happens inside you, the happening

Now I see life for what it is
It's not all dreams, ooh, it's not all bliss
It happened to me and it can happen to you

Once

Is it real, is it fake
Is this game of life a mistake?

Sky pilot,
How high can you fly?

He feels good, with God you're never alone
He feels tired and he lays on his bed
Hopes the men will find courage
In the words that he said

You'll never, never, never reach the sky.

You're soldiers of God, you must understand
The fate of your country is in your young hands
May God give you strength
Do your job real well
If it all was worth it
Only time it will tell

With tears in their eyes
The stench of death drifts up to the skies

Remembers the words
""Thou shalt not kill.""

Ricordo un angolo di cielo
Dove ti stavo ad aspettar
Ricordo il volto tanto amato
E la tua bocca da baciar

Non è più triste il mio cammino

On l'entendit sonner un jour
Même jusqu'aux villes voisines
De Portofino pour notre amour

Je vois le marié qui m'emporte
Et le petit chalet de bois
Dont il me fait franchir la porte
En me portant entre ses bras

and hold her; and I soon forget there's another world outside.
'cause she's a friend, she's a lover, she's a woman, she's a wife.
She's the answered prayer ev'ry lonely man dreams of.
She's a temptress, she's a lady, she's the mother of my baby.

Is it you again coming 'round for more
Well you can love me tonight if you want
But in the morning make sure you're gone
I'm talkin' to you
Hot legs, wearing me out
Hot legs, you can scream and shout
Hot legs, are you still in school
I love you honey

Gotta most persuasive tongue
You promise all kinds of fun
But what you don't understand
I'm a working man
Gonna need a shot of vitamin E
By the time you're finished with me
I'm talking to you
Hot legs, you're an alley cat
Hot legs, you scratch my back
Hot legs, bring your mother too
I love you honey

Imagine how my daddy felt
in your jet black suspender belt
Seventeen years old
He's touching sixty four

You got legs right up to your neck
You're making me a physical wreck
I'm talking to you
Hot legs, in your satin shoes
Hot legs, are you still in school
Hot legs, you're making me a fool
I love you honey

Hot legs, making your mark
Hot legs, keep my pencil sharp
Hot legs, keep your hands to yourself
I love you honey
Hot legs, you're wearing me out
Hot legs, you can scream and shout
Hot legs, you're still in school

Did he tell you that your heart
Would soon become another trinket on his bracelet
Of broken hearts?
Did he tell you that the morning sun
Would find you patching up your shattered pride and
Searching for the missing part
Did he tell you that the special love your saving
Will disappear in flames of shame like mine
Did he tell you
That he's known as
Johnny One Time?

So, he told you
That he'd never lead
Your heart astray
And he told you
That he'd love you
Forever and a day

The switch is flicked
The bomb is lit
Spark the wick
I hit the fuse
Lifes a bitch
I insist my bitch she will move
Wise minded guy
Since flipping bricks in business school
Timing its critical
Minimized on online clicks
Not ridiculed or silenced
I'm real eyes and your minuscule
Sly individuals commit sadistic crime and rituals
Then views get a boost
You sick the spooks yet?
Shits typical
Set the trap back
Home alone
Growing though
Post Malone's posts are shown
Boasting hoes won't know a foe
So croak and overflown the locust show
In the streets I see drones
Zooming in
Zoning in
Scoping my dome
In Facebook jail?
No. I am on Instagram death row
Said my president is a terror
It is embarrassing
You regretting it? No
It is obstruction of justice
I think Steve Jobs, Walt Disney, and Dr. King would be disgusted
Cuz of this a comeuppance is coming
So much to say
So many rhymes
So ready
Aim
Fire
I steady supply
Plenty enemies scope me
The want me dead or alive
My pen never hits empty
Vengeance has kept me in line
Trite sniper
Night flight of a bright writer
Incite of the light. Heightened might
Spun to strike like the white lighter
Off the vine. Sought to shine. Thought divine
You brought your wife?
Why? I might pipe her
Even when calm I am quite hyper
Commence the purge
Instead of settling nerves
Get set. Manny men said ready the hearse
The first second I met a verse
Fuck what you heard
Marked sucker turds
In other words
I am bucking nerds
Struck roughest with words
Got nothing but pure
So, no way in hell you will ever dwell in my elements
This artist official intelligence level
Excel in expelling fellas selling
But felt a prick melt in
Oh my am I out of order?
Boss of the slaughter
WV Aura's quite larger than my persona
So much to say
So many rhymes
So ready

Sin committing crescendo
Kick in your living-room window
Entering the crib
Convincing kids to sniff snow
While investing in crypto
Incredibly sick flow
Its chlamyd and Syph ill is
On a thick hoe
Infecting the menstrual
Wreck instrumentals
Indigenous to this
Subdivision of schizo
The cynical menace is in
Ill will in him
He'll still sic on the shitshow
Tip to rift tripping cliff notes
Ridiculous trends go
Revenge holds ten-fold
Still unwell
Lymph nodes been swollen
But will fulfill impossible shit
Fit a pit-bull in fishbowl
Far from biddable
Grip the sickle
Hun, brittle? No.
Catching wind with a gremlin grin and special credentials
Binge indigo piff and benzos
Told a bitch at Fish Co. bet them lips can blow
Got her digits and dipped in Six-Four
Listen to Nick Pro
Shucks! Collision again
Just hit a limo. Fuck. Got to run. Split quick

And I should have known, there's no need to pick up the phone
When you called, saying I treated you unkind
So when I came by to see if we could try
And answer why it didn't work last time
Well, I talked about the other man and how I had my doubts

And knowing what it means to her
In the eyes of that girl
I am everything to her

When the statue on the pedestal
Comes crumbling to the ground?
I don't want to be around
To see the sorrow on her face
When she thinks I let her down
And what happens
When she finds the world is real
And not the fairy-land she thinks it is?
That I'm a man who lives and breathes
And makes mistakes and not a
Superman she dreamed
Blessed is the strength she finds in me
And the weakness she'll never see
I'll go before the image falls apart

Without overthinking, fear sinking
Almost reaching, negatives preaching 
When sadness tries to synch in 
Pause like intermission, free, the mind 
Align with the royal stars, venture far 
Never be afraid, be farther than I, star 
Believe in your light, always fight

But I promise this a better life, Yea

Since I didn’t cry at uncles funeral 
Scared of mans images, years later, I’m feeling wrong 
My body ache from damages, from times 
I missed moments of cherishing college times
I chose bridges, over the family 
Chose to accept the act of dying 
I Chose, those who oppose the happiness
Sacrifices, advices, I took blinding 
Religion I accepted blinded 
Made me feel less than who I was
But dang I didn’t need depression back then 
Now why I Soft Cell taint this feeling
Or Joker my Harley, I’m the true villain

Seen why she loved me, since she was a sophomore
I put cracks in her crown, and stupidly let her go 
Drove to town, trying to Ibuprofen the sore 
I knew she was grieving, but dang that same evening 
I'm driving I-4, when I hit the brakes  
I seen two car sides crash
I’m on the phone, screaming out wait
As the car in front of me, wasn’t lucky with its brakes 
It hits the railing, I keep sailing shaken

As long as you're walking beside me, I'll always be a dreamer
As long as we're sharing, the smiles and the sorrows
Will make everyday we're together, a day to remember
I have no illusions, just a heart full of lovin'
It's a wonderful world I know, whenever you're near

To the door of the sun, to the ends of the sea
I will travel anywhere as long as you are there with me
On the wings of the wind, in the arms of a storm
It is always summer weather, with your love to keep me warm

Alle porte del sole
Ai confini del mare
Quante volte col pensiero
Ti ho portato insieme a me
Ti ho portato insieme a me
Ti ho portato insieme a me

Insieme a me",5,3,7,6

Got a (got a)
Baby
Say that one more time Brenda
Brenda's
Got a (baby)
Baby

I hear Brenda's got a baby
But Brenda's barely got a brain
A damn shame, the girl can hardly spell her name
(That's not our problem, that's up to Brenda's family)
Well, let me show ya how it affects the whole community
Now Brenda really never knew her moms and her dad was a
Junky, puttin' death to his arms, it's sad 'cause I bet
Brenda doesn't even know
Just 'cause you're in the ghetto doesn't mean you can't grow (you can't grow)
But oh, that's a thought, my own revelation
Do whatever it takes to resist the temptation
Brenda got herself a boyfriend
Her boyfriend was her cousin, now let's watch the joy end
She tried to hide her pregnancy, from her family
Who didn't really care to see, or give a damn if she
Went out and had a church of kids
As long as when the check came they got first dibs
Now Brenda's belly is gettin' bigger
But no one seems to notice any change in her figure
She's 12 years old and she's having a baby
In love with the molester, who's sexing her crazy
And yet and also she thinks that he'll be with her forever
And dreams of a world with the two of them are together
Whatever, he left her and she had the baby solo
She had it on the bathroom floor and didn't know so
She didn't know, what to throw away and what to keep
She wrapped the baby up and threw him in the trash heep
I guess she thought she'd get away, wouldn't hear the cries
She didn't realize
How much the the little baby had her eyes
Now the baby's in the trash heep balling
Momma can't help her, but it hurts to hear her calling
Brenda wants to run away
Momma say, ""you makin' me lose pay
And social workers here everyday""
Now Brenda's gotta make her own way
Can't go to her family, they won't let her stay
No money, no babysitter, she couldn't keep a job
She tried to sell crack, but end up getting robbed
So now what's next, there ain't nothing left to sell
So she sees sex as a way of leaving hell
It's paying the rent, so she really can't complain
Prostitute, found slain, and Brenda's her name, she's got a baby

357,13121,Have You Had Any Lately,SYLVIA ROBINSON,1970,"Like Malcolm said it I gotta get it by any means
Coming from a place gunshots wake you up out your sleep
Trying to make it global its niggas dying from local beef
Crabs in a barrel its so much negative energy
You think small so you could never connect with me
The majority of you are not who you pretend to be
And they're scary they're just as yellow as cheddar cheese
Make a game plan its so many possibilities
No time
To fall behind
With small minds
And that Glock nine
I kept mine
At all times
Now i'm just fine
I sip wine
In sunshine
On the west coast
Take boat rides
In low tides
Did everything but sky dive
And rock climb
Maybe soon i'll schedule that with some white guys
Ghostwriting verses now people heard me about time
Write it and record it producing slaps from both sides
I'll make my home in this game we call entertainment
Drop a little EP for a down payment
Growing up I never said that I want to be famous
That idea was abstract Jackson Pollock painting
Louisiana nigga wildin' out in California
Made a solid game plan then I had to run it
Setbacks and distractions I seen 'em by the dozens
Stay focused make connections bro and get your money
Blew some bags in my past I was just a young'n
Now i'm making plays with the bucks like my nigga Gannis
Antetokounmpo
Need my pockets on Sumo
Heart colder than Juneau
But twenty-four K like Bruno
Had a Latina Dallas who grew up in a group home
I could have been her Chulo
But moneys numero uno
Help your family that's one of the major keys
Never stingy with money since we were teens
Because I know just how hard the struggle can be
I hate not being able to help when family's in need
My cousin had some offenses
They issued warrants to get him
He needed bread for defense just
Stop him going to prison
My homie called me up tripping
He lost his job in the city
He needed money for rent and he
And checked his stash and its empty
Check my past and i'm simply REAL
I'm not a gangsta but I handle all beef myself
Just a hood nigga with that heat on my belt
Squeeze triggers like sicarios in cartels
If you've never joined a gang then you're not a gangsta
Most of you are not the characters that you're portraying
Clout chasing for your music so the kids play it
If you're from the burbs be proud can we trade places
If your life was a book would you write changes
I would probably scribble out where there was time wasted
I know now that i'm bigger than my imagination
I'm from a place where very few do something amazing
I would have less fun and more inspiration
Til me and Jay Z where on a first name basis
Peace out is how I greet these haters
You don't like it i'm unbothered I don't need these haters
Claim you got it on Lock had to teach these haters
I'm a MAC can't Control Alt Delete me haters
Command Option Escape
Force quit on these lames
Who I am is the same
But my situation changed
Who you are is a shame
And your situation came
Out to be worst than what it was when you started the game
Living for clout
Didn't help anyone out
Didn't invest any money
Didn't buy your mom a house
Catch 'em talking to producers trying to lower the amount
How're you cheap talk people with those diamonds in your mouth
Getting strong eating beats like children taking a vitamin
Even when I was little I always had some fight in me
Ghostwriting hits now all of these rappers biting me
I'm not even on Tender and all of these bitches swiping me
Made a couple rappers greater and I did it quietly
Living like a regular person out in society
Haters want me gone the industry has its eye on me
I'm too busy winning for now and as far as I can see
I'm working on my temp now
Trying not to flip out
Cool until i'm pissed now
Working all my sins out
Grind I can't quit now
If i'm ever locked down
Beat the case mistrial
Never turn snitch now
Never rat friends out
Don't care how it sounds
Right here in this town
Seen a couple big clowns
Flex what they did now
Feds in the mix now
Judge heard you spit now
Ain't talking shit now
Rep Louisiana like ASAP in Harlem i'm
At the club and I party with
College girls in their dorms
And women working on jobs
With strippers thots and some models and
Cougars with grown daughters and
I was swimming in all of 'em
Showing off guns on Instagram live
Trying to make people think you're some kinda bad guy
Call people out then you run from the damn fight
See 'em on the streets then wait for them to pass by
Not concerned with rappers claiming they're on
Record sales and streams proving em wrong
Drogon when i'm snappin' on a song
Flames hot enough to melt the Iron Throne
Dinosaur i'm a Mastodon
Future king i'm a champion
Spit a verse on a sample song
Eat the track that i'm rapping on
New shovel I have it yo
Bury niggas in catacombs
Add a verse to you're favorite jawn
Like a bonus i'll add it on
Half of you are clones
Don't come at me wrong
I'll expose you like insta thots with just panties on
Then explode that little clout that you're standing on
Call your lady's phone
Now her things are gone
When you make it home
Something like a divorce
You should have stayed on course
The rap game is yours
But I snuck indoors
Like a Trojan horse
In the Trojan wars
I was chosen boy
But my Achilles heal is just selling words that I wrote before
Nah let me elaborate more
My Achilles heal was just not knowing i'm chosen boy
Now I finally get it my ambition is take whats yours
Til my team is eating like we all live in a grocery store
Now I finally get it so my ambition is take whats yours
Til my team is eating like we all live in a grocery store
Think about whats on my mind before you step to me
You don't know whats in it like cheap molly and XTC
Cookin' beats with flames
These other rappers could never see
My plan to kill the game
Call it my rest in peace

And knowledge can be the difference between life or death
You should know the truth and the truth shall set you free

I was raised like a Muslim prayin' to the East
Nature of my life relates rhymes I release
Like a cannon 'cause I been plannin' to be rammin' what I wrote
Straight on a plate down your throat
So digest as I suggest we take a good look
At who's who while I'm readin' from my good book
And let's dig into every nook and every cranny
Set your mind free as I slam these thoughts
And just like a jammy goes, ""Baow""
You're gonna see what I'm sayin' now
You can't be sleepin' 'cause things are gettin' crazy
You better stop being lazy, there's many people frontin'
And many brothers droppin'
All because of dumb things, let me tell you somethin'
I've been through so much that I'm such
A maniac, but I still act out of faith
That we can get the shit together so I break
On fools with no rhymes skills messin' up the flow
And people with no sense who be movin' much too slow
And so, you will know the meaning of the Gang Starr
Guru with the mic and Premier raise the anchor
Swiftly, as we embark on a journey, I had to get an attorney
I needed someone to defend my position
Decisions I made, 'cause now it's time to get paid
And ladies, these rhymes are like the keys to a dope car
Maybe a Lexus or a Jaguar
Still, all of that is just material
So won't you dig the scenario
And just imagine if each one is teachin' one
We'll come together so that we become
A strong force, then we can stay on course
Find your direction through introspection
And for my people out there I got a question
Can we be the sole controllers of our fate?
Now who's gonna take the weight?

You can't, you can't, you can't
You can't handle the whole weight
You can't handle the whole weight

The weight of the world is heavy on my mind
So as my feelings unwind I find
That some try to be down just 'cause it's trendy
Others fall victim to envy
But I'll take the road less travelled
So I can see all my hopes and my dreams unravel
Relievin' your stress, expressin' my interest
In the situation that you're facin'
That's why I'm down with the Nation
Spirituality supports reality
We gotta fight with the right mentality
So we can gain what is rightfully ours
This is the meaning of the chain and the star
Land is power, so gimme forty acres
Let's see how far I can take ya
Original invincible
That's how I'm lookin' at it
I use my rhymes like a Glock automatic
Any means necessary, I'm goin' all out
Before the rains bring the nuclear fallout
So let me ask you, is it too late?
Ayo, who's gonna take the weight?

You can't handle the whole weight
You can't, you can't, you can't handle the whole weight

That I never can say goodbye, no, no, no, no, now

Piercing me right through the core

You know you love him more and more

There's that anguish, there's that doubt

Or looks my way, or calls my name
That seems to leave this troubled world behind
If I'm feeling down and blue
Or troubled by some foolish game
She always seems to make me change my mind

And I feel fine anytime she's around me now
She's around me now
Almost all the time
And if I'm well you can tell she's been with me now
She's been with me now quite a long, long time
And I feel fine

Every now and then the things I lean on lose their meaning
And I find myself careening
In places where I should not let me go
She has the power to go where no one else can find me
Yes and silently remind me
The happiness and the good times that I know, but as I had got to know them

It isn't what she's got to say
But how she thinks and where she's been
To me, the words are nice, the way they sound
I like to hear them best that way
It doesn't much matter what they mean
What she says them mostly just to calm me down

And I feel fine anytime she's around me now
She's around me now
Almost all the time
If I'm well you can tell she's been with me now
She's been with me now quite a long, long time
Yes and I feel fine",5,2,6,7

384,14179,King Heroin,JAMES BROWN,1972,"Ladies and gentlemen
Fellow Americans
Lady Americans
This is James Brown

I wanna talk to you about one of our
Most deadly, killers in the country today
I had a dream the other night, and I
Was sittin' in my living room

Dozed off to sleep
So I start to dreamin'
I dreamed I walked in a place and
I saw a real strange, weird object

Standin' up talkin' to the people
And I found out it was heroin
That deadly drug that go in your veins
He says

I came to this country without a passport
Ever since then I've been hunted and sought
My little white grains are nothin' but waste
Soft and deadly and bitter to taste

I'm a world of power and all know it's true
Use me once and you'll know it, too
I can make a mere schoolboy forget his books
I can make a world-famous beauty neglect her looks

I can make a good man forsake his wife
Send a greedy man to prison for the rest of his life
I can make a man forsake his country and flag
Make a girl sell her body for a five-dollar bag

Some think my adventure's a joy and a thrill
But I'll put a gun in your hand and make you kill
In cellophane bags, I've found my way
To heads of state and children at play

I'm financed in China, ran in Japan
I'm respected in Turkey and I'm legal in Siam
I take my addicts and make 'em steal, borrow, beg
Then they search for a vein in their arm or their leg

So, be you Italian, Jewish, Black or Mex
I can make the most virile of men forget their sex
So now, no, my man, you must, you know, do your best
To keep up your habit until your arrest

Now the police have taken you from under my wing
Do you think they dare defy me, I who am king
Now, you must lie in that county jail
Where I can't get to you by visit or mail

So squirm, with discomfort, wiggle and cough
Six days of madness, you might throw me off
Curse me in name, defy me in speech
But you'd pick me up right no if I were in your reach

All through your sentence you've become resolved to your fate
Hear now young man and woman, I'll be waitin' at the gate
And don't be afraid, don't run, I'm not chased
Sure my name is Heroin, you'll be back for a taste

Behold, you're hooked, your foot is in the stirrup
And make, haste, mount the steed and ride him well
For the white horse of heroin will ride you to Hell, to Hell
Will ride you to Hell until you are dead
Dead, brother, dead

This is a revolution of the mind
Get your mind together
And get away from drugs
That's the man

Illinois Central, Monday morning rail
Fifteen cars and fifteen restless riders
Three conductors, twenty-five sacks of mail
All along the southbound odyssey
The train pulls out at Kankakee
And rolls along past houses, farms and fields
Passin' trains that have no names
And freight yards full of old black men
And the graveyards of the rusted automobiles

Good morning America, how are you?
Said, ""Don't you know me, I'm your native son""
I'm the train they call The City of New Orleans
I'll be gone five hundred miles when the day is done

Dealin' cards games with the old men in the club car
Penny a point, ain't no one keepin' score
Pass the paper bag that holds the bottle
And feel the wheels rumblin' 'neath the floor
And the sons of Pullman porters
And the sons of engineers
Ride their father's magic carpets made of steel
And mothers with their babes asleep
Are rockin' to the gentle beat
And the rhythm of the rails is all they feel

Good morning, America, how are you?
Said, ""Don't you know me, I'm your native son""
I'm the train they call The City of New Orleans
I'll be gone five hundred miles when the day is done

Nighttime on The City of New Orleans
Changin' cars in Memphis, Tennessee
Half way home, but we'll be there by morning
Through the Mississippi darkness
Rollin' down to the sea
But all the towns and people seem
To fade into a bad dream
And the steel rail still ain't heard the news
The conductor sings his songs again
The passengers will please refrain
This train got the disappearing railroad blues

'Round about their homes

The people of the town are strange
And they're proud of where they came
Well, you're talkin' 'bout china grove
Oh, China grove

Well, the preacher and the teacher
Lord, they're a caution
They are the talk of the town
When the gossip gets to flyin'
And they ain't lyin'
When the sun goes fallin' down

They say that the father's insane
And dear Missus Perkin's a game
We're talkin' 'bout the china grove
Oh, China grove

But every day there's a new thing comin'
The ways of an oriental view
The sheriff and his buddies
With their samurai swords
You can even hear the music at night

And though it's a part of the lone star state
People don't seem to care
They just keep on lookin' to the east

And they whirled and they twirled and they tangoed
Singin' and jinglin' the jango
Floatin' like the heavens above
It looks like muskrat love

Nibblin' on bacon, Chewin' on cheese
Sammy says to Suisie ""Honey would you please be my missus?""
And she says yes
With her kisses

And now he's ticklin' her fancy
Rubbin' her toes,
Muzzle to muzzle, now anything goes

It's a shame these slugs ain't real
But we can't have dancin' at the local county jail

And for miles around
You could hear the sirens wail
There's a rumor goin' 'round death row
That a fuse is gonna blow
At the local hop at the local county jail (whatcha gonna do about it, whatcha gonna do?)

Whatcha gonna do about it, whatcha gonna do?

Sergeant Baker started talkin' with a bullhorn in his hand (bullhorn in his hand, bullhorn in his hand)
He was cool, he was clear, he was always in command (always in command, always in command)
He said ""Blood will flow, here Padre
Padre you talk to your boys""
""Trust in me

I am the morning DJ on WOLD
Playing all the hits for you wherever you may be
The bright good-morning voice who's heard but never seen
Feeling all of forty-five going on fifteen
The drinking I did on my last big gig made my voice go low
They said that they liked the younger sound when they let me go
So I drifted on down to Tulsa, Oklahoma to do me a late night talk show
Now I worked my way back home again, via Boise, Idhao
That's how this business goes

I've been making extra money playing high school sock hops
I'm a big time guest MC
You should hear me talking to the little children
And listen what they say to me
Got a spot on the top of my head, begging for a new toupee
And a tire on my gut from sitting on my
But they're never gonna go away
Sometimes I get this crazy dream
That I just drive off in my car
But you can travel on ten thousand miles and still say where you are
I've been thinking that I should quit disk jockeying
And start that record store

Maybe I could settle down if you'ld take me back once more
Okay honey, I see
I guess he's better than me
Sure, old girl, I understand
You don't have to worry, I'm such a happy man

I remember just how good the feeling was
Put it proudly in my car
And I played my friends a thousand times
My two song repertoire
And I told my mom her oldest son was gonna be star

I bought all the Beatles records
And I tried to sound like Paul
I bought all the old Buddy Holly's, the 78s and all
And I sat by my record player playing every song they played
And I watched them all on TV every move they made

Rock and Roll, I gave you all the best years of my life
The dreamy sunny Sundays
All the magic moonlit nights
I was so busy in the backroom
Writing love songs to you
While you were changing your direction
I never even knew
That I was always one step behind you

'66 seemed like the year I was really going somewhere
We were living in San Francisco with flowers in our hair
Singing songs of kindness so the world would understand
That the guys and me were something more
Than just another band

And '69 in LA well it came around so slow
But we were really making headway and writin' lots of toons
We must have played the wildest stuff we had ever played
Because the way the crowds yelled out for more we thought we had it made

Rock and Roll, I gave you all the best years of my life
Playing my guitar under bright and flashing lights
I was so busy on the road singing love songs to you
While you were changing your direction I never even knew
That I was always one step behind you

'71 in Soho when I met Suzanne
I was trying to go it solo with some else's band
And she came up to me later on and I took her by the hand
And I told her all my troubles and she seemed to understand
And she followed me to London through a hundred hotel rooms
Through a hundred record companies that didn't like my tunes
And she followed me 'til finally I sold my old guitar
And she tried to help me understand that I would never be a star

Rock and Roll, I gave you all the best years of my life
The dreamy sunny Sundays
All the magic moonlit nights
And though I've never had the chance
Of making it with you
I thank the lord for giving me the little bit I knew
And I will always be one step behind you

Rock and Roll, I gave you all the best years of my life
Singing out my love songs",5,3,2,4

You just ditch him when the sun goes down

But he ain't your fool like Wolfman Jack

I don't mean to treat you evil
I'm just a good boy gone bad
But if I catch you after dark walking through the park
I'm just liable to do something mad

You maybe think you know what love is about girl
But it's nothing 'til it's Wolfman Jack
And everybody knows, you go round and shout it
That your only thrill is Wolfman Jack

Full moon tonight, everything's all right
Baby come on back to Wolfman Jack
I may miss your loving while I'm on my back
But you can't escape from Wolfman Jack
You can't do this to me

You got my great big eyes spinning 'round in my head
How could you love another man instead?",3,6,1,2

I watch a phone that never rings, I watch a door that never rings

Niggas thinking it's a wrap, see we can't hustle in they trap, we ain't from (Georgia)
Now it's them dead bodies, them lost houses, the mayor say don't worry 'bout it
And the children have been scarred, no one's here to care 'bout 'em
And fash out, to all the rappers that helped out
Yea we like it they calling y'all, but fuck president (Georgia) Bush
We see them Confederate flags, you know what it is
A white cracker motherfucker that probably voted for him
And no he ain't gonna drop no dollars, but he do drop bombs
R.I.P. Tay cause he died in the storm, fuck president (Georgia) Bush
See us in ya city man, give us a pound
Cause if a nigga still moving then he holding it down

Wait 'til everybody's long gone
There must be so many things that we can explore
Maybe I can walk you home
If it starts to rain we can take some shelter
I'd like to hold your little hand
My heart is spinning like a helter-skelter
We'll get to know each other if we can

[Chorus]
She said hey wait a minute hold on
She said hey just a little bit hold on
When ever I try to think of what it feels like to feel it
For the first time, and was it really such a thrill
She said look, boy but don't you touch
That ain't much only a school boy crush

Got to keep this secret can't take no chance
Don't want nobody else to know
There is nothing wrong with trying to start a romance
But we should take it rather slow
If we play it cool it'll be all right
Don't let the teacher see us talking
But after school we will be out of sight
Everybody gonna think we just gone walkin'

They said there'll be peace on earth
But instead it just kept on raining
A veil of tears for the virgin birth
I remember one Christmas morning
A winter's light and a distant choir
And the peal of a bell and that Christmas tree smell
And their eyes full of tinsel and fire

They sold me a dream of Christmas
They sold me a silent night
And they told me a fairy story
'Till I believed in the Israelite
And I believed in father Christmas
And I looked to the sky with excited eyes
'Till I woke with a yawn in the first light of dawn
And I saw him and through his disguise

I wish you a hopeful Christmas
I wish you a brave new year
All anguish, pain and sadness

All aboard America here comes the freedom train

The freedom train is rolling down two hundred years of track
Two hundred years of glory never to turn back
The train is called America your ticket is a dream
That left the torture of freedom for all the world to see
She left the station in Lexington in 1776
And rode to Philadelphia where the liberty bell was fixed
George Washington was the engineer John Adams shoveled coal
And Franklin punched the tickets Tom Jefferson added soul
All aboard America here comes the freedom train

She rode to New Orleans the battle of 1812
With old Hickory at the throttle she drove the British out
The freedom train's a fine train the toppest of world it seemed
Her whistle blows for the liberty with a mighty head of steam
Wheels of fortune sweaty Pittsburgh rolled across the Mississippi
From Texas to Missouri to one real exciting trip
Then bang of track was broken smashed by a cannonball
That blew in great divided will the nation stand or fall
All aboard America here comes the freedom train

Will Annistage stepped into the cab and the wheels began to roll
Freedom train must never stop Republic never fall
To the bloody fields of Gettysburg the tear show in his eyes
She drove the train with fury the freedom train survive
Again the train rode westward to California shores
To the deserts and prairies even stronger than before
From Atlantic to Pacific she drove the rail with pride
She traveled a track to glory with the good Lord on her side
All aboard America here comes the freedom train

There's much more to this story like Wilson and Roosevelt
They left the train to Truman who stoked it mighty well
Then old Dwight D Eisenhower or LBJ we sing
Two brothers known as Kennedy and Martin Luther King
And still the train rolls forward over history's rugged trail
Straightening by the journey and the land beneath her rail
And you and I roll along and stroke the freedom fire
For we stand to all Americans hold old honor can't be hired
All aboard America here comes the freedom train",6,2,7,4

You get to know your lover mostly by feel

With the things they reveal
They show it all without revealing too much
Scare the hell out of you
'Cause me and my love
Live among the shadows
Where the old playground is an alley way
Now me and my love make love among the shadows
When the sun goes down in a dark hallway
Love in the shadows where the crowd never goes
Deep in the shadows where flowers won't grow
Me and my baby know love in the shadows
In the shadows
You got to work at love to get it to shine
You can't believe in everything that you see
Not this time around
'Cause the shadows can play
A half a million tricks on your mind
You try your best but you can never break free
It just kind of drags you down
'Cause me and my love
Live among the shadows
Where the old playground is an alley way
Now me and my love make love among the shadows
When the sun goes down in a dark hallway
Love in the shadows where the sun never shines
Deep in the shadows where most men go blind

Saint Peter, don't you call me 'cause I can't go
I owe my soul to the company store

I was born one morning when the sun didn't shine
I picked up my shovel and I walked to the mine
I loaded sixteen tons of number 9 coal
And the straw boss said, ""Well, a-bless my soul""

You load sixteen tons, what do you get?
Another day older and deeper in debt
Saint Peter, don't you call me 'cause I can't go
I owe my soul to the company store

I was born one morning, it was drizzling rain
Fighting and trouble are my middle name
I was raised in the canebrake by an ol' mama lion

You load sixteen tons, what do you get?
Another day older and deeper in debt
Saint Peter, don't you call me 'cause I can't go

448,16530,I.O.U.,JIMMY DEAN,1976,"Many people look through their wallet or their pocket books and, way down at the bottom, past the
credit cards and baby pictures and so on, you usually find a little 'ol piece of dog-eared poetry.
I was cleaning out my wallet the other day and ran across a whole bunch of I.O.U's, some of 'em
thirty-five years overdue. And you know the funny thing, all these I.O.U's are owed to one person
and I kinda felt like that maybe now would be a pretty good time for an accountin'.

Mom, I sure hope you're listenin'.

Sweet lady, I.O.U. for so many things.....
A lot of services, like nightwatchman for instance.....
Lyin' awake nights, listenin' for coughs and cries and creakin'
floorboards.....hah-hah, and me comin' in too late.
Boy, you had the eye of an eagle and the roar of a lion,
But you always had a heart as big as a house.

I.O.U. for services like, uh, short order cook, chef, baker.....
For makin' sirloin out o' hamburger an' turkey out o' tuna fish,
And big ol' strappin' boys out of leftovers.

I.O.U. for cleanin' services,
The daily scrubbing of face and ears....all work done by hand.
And for the frequent dustin' of a small boy's pants
To try to make sure that you led a spotless life.
And for washin' and ironin' that no laundry could ever do.
Foy dryin' the tears of childhood
And ironin' out the problems of growin' up.

I.O.U. for services as a bodyguard,
For protectin' me from the terrors of thunderstorms and nightmares
Hah, And too many green apples.

And Lord knows, I.O.U. for medical attention,
For nursing me through measles, mumps, bruises,
Bumps, splinters and spring fever.
Oh-oh, let's not forget medical advice....important things like,
""If you keep on scratching that, it'll never get well"" or
""If you cross your eyes, they're gonna stick like that"".
And probably the most important advice of all,
""Boy, you be sure you got on clean underwear, in case you're in an accident"".

And I.O.U. for veterinarian services,
For feeding every lost dog that I dragged home at the end of the rope,
And for healing the pains of puppy love.

And I.O.U. for entertainment.....
Entertainment that kept the household goin' through some pretty rough times.....
And for wonderful productions at Christmas, the Fourth of July, Birthdays.....
And for making make-believe come true.....
And you did it all on such a limited budget.

I.O.U. for construction work, for building kites and confidence, hopes and dreams an'.....
Somehow you made them all touch the sky.....
And for cementin' together a family
So it would stand the worst kind of shocks and blows.....
And for layin' down a good strong foundation to build a life on.

I.O.U. for carrier charges.....
For carryin' me on your books for the necessities of life
That a growin' boy somehow, well, they just gotta have.
Things like, hah-hah, a pair of high top boots,
With a little pocket on the side for a jack-knife.

And one thing, Mom, I'll never forget....
When there were two pieces of pie and three hungry people.....
You were always the one who decided, well, I'm not really that hungry anyhow.

These are just a few of the things for which payment is long overdue..
The person that I owe 'em to worked very, very cheap....
She managed by simply doin' without a whole lot o' things that she needed herself....
My I.O.U's add up to more than I could ever hope to repay,
But you know the nicest thing about it all....
That I know, that she had marked the entire bill 'Paid In Full'
For just one kiss and four little words....Mom, I Love You!",5,1,7,7

唱︰杜雯惠
曲︰Carole King / Gerry Goffin
詞︰Carole King / Gerry Goffin

Tonight you're mine completely
You give your love so sweetly
Tonight the light of love is in your eyes
But will you love me tomorrow?

Is this a lasting treasure
Or just one moment's pleasure?
Can I believe the magic of your sighs?
Will you still love me tomorrow?

Tonight with words unspoken
You say that I'm the only one
But will my heart be broken
When the night meets that morning sun?",5,2,3,4
450,16611,A Butterfly For Bucky,BOBBY GOLDSBORO,1976,"Buck was born on a beautiful morning
And I felt very proud
Lets just say its not every day
That you see me cry out loud

Hair like sunshine, a smile as warm
And the prettiest eyes you'll find
One day last spring my lady and I
Found out those eyes were blind

[Chorus]
Have a butterfly for me daddy
They sound so pretty to me
Tell me about the butterfly
And all the things you see

Well over there Buck lies a beautiful meadow
With the colors of gold and tan
With the smell of hay and the sound of crickets
Here Buck, take my hand

And I wish you could see that big oak tree
With its limbs reaching up to the sky
And a bed of flowers growing at its feet
And a big yellow butterfly

Save a butterfly for me daddy
Before they disappear
Save a butterfly for me daddy
And on his cheek was a tiny tear

So we packed up our bags our hopes and our dreams
And we all went to town that day
I sneaked off to the hospital chapel
I got down on my knees and I prayed

Save a butterfly for my boy lord
I sure need nothing for me
Except an angel of joy to touch him
The way that he's touched me

Now there are things in this universe
That we just don't understand
And through an open window came a butterfly
To land on Buck's small hand

The doctor's face was strangely white
As if it just couldn't be
But the light was in my boys face
Daddy he said, I can see

Save a butterfly for us Bucky
We're all so blind it seems
For we've not seen the magic
In the power of a little boy's dreams",5,1,6,7

And she knows (and she knows) the hell I'm going through
In this world (in this world) inside my head
There's a devil (there's a devil) in a bottle
And he wants to see me dead

462,17161,The Killing Of Georgie (Parts 1 And 2),ROD STEWART,1977,"Oh yeah
In these days of changing ways
So called liberated days
A story comes to mind of a friend of mine

Georgie boy was gay I guess
Nothin' more or nothin' less
The kindest guy I ever knew

His mother's tears fell in vain
The afternoon George tried to explain
That he needed love like all the rest

Pa said there must be a mistake
How can my son not be straight
After all I've said and done for him

Da da da da da da duh
Da da da da da da duh
Da da da da da da duh

Leavin' home on a Greyhound bus
Cast out by the ones he loves
A victim of these gay days it seems

Da da da da da da duh
Da da da da da da duh
Da da da da da da duh

Georgie went to New York town
Where he quickly settled down
And soon became the toast of the great white way

Accepted by Manhattan's elite
In all the places that were chic
No party was complete without George

Along the boulevards he'd cruise
And all the old queens blew a fuse
Everybody loved Georgie boy

Da da da da da da duh
Da da da da da da duh
Da da da da da da duh

The last time I saw George alive
Was in the summer of seventy-five
He said he was in love I said I'm pleased

George attended the opening night
Of another Broadway hype
But split before the final curtain fell

Deciding to take a short cut home
Arm in arm they meant no wrong
A gentle breeze blew down fifth avenue

Da da da da da da duh
Da da da da da da duh
Da da da da da da duh

Out of a darkened side street came
A New Jersey gang with just one aim
To roll some innocent passer-by
There ensued a fearful fight
Screams rang out in the night
Georgie's head hit a sidewalk cornerstone

A leather kid, a switchblade knife
He did not intend to take his life
He just pushed his luck a little too far that night

The sight of blood dispersed the gang
A crowd gathered, the police came
An ambulance screamed to a halt on fifty-third and third

Da da da da da da duh
Da da da da da da duh
Da da da da da da duh

Georgie's life ended there
But I ask who really cares
George once said to me and I quote

He said ""never wait or hesitate
Get in kid, before it's too late
You may never get another chance
'Cause youth a mask but it don't last
Live it long and live it fast""
Georgie was a friend of mine

I said, ""Pops, them from Mike, man, you better save 'em""

Took Dr. Sebi's herbs instead of medication
Breathing heavy, he talked reparations
He said, ""Son, we live through our generations""

491,18015,What A Fool Believes,THE DOOBIE BROTHERS,1979,"He came from somewhere back in her long ago
The sentimental fool don't see
Trying hard to recreate what had yet to be created
Once in her life, she musters a smile for his nostalgic tale
Never coming near what he wanted to say
Only to realize it never really was

She had a place in his life
He never made her think twice
As he rises to her apology
Anybody else would surely know
He's watching her go

But what a fool believes he sees
No wise man has the power to reason away
What seems to be
Is always better than nothing
Than nothing at all keeps sending him

Somewhere back in her long ago
Where he can still believe there's a place in her life
Someday, somewhere, she will return

She had a place in his life
He never made her think twice
As he rises to her apology
Anybody else would surely know
He's watching her go

But what a fool believes he sees
No wise man has the power to reason away
What seems to be (if love can come and love can go, then why can't love return once more?)
Is always better than nothing
(Who got the power?)
Than nothing at all (oh, now)
What a fool believes he sees (I believe she's never gone away)
No wise man has the power

She came in the morning
With the US mail
She didn't say nothing
But she looked pretty good to me

Golden hair that shines so bright
Loving eyes that see not sight
She could keep the secrets
That we share in my world of dreams

And a man needs something
When he ain't got nothing to hold onto
And there ain't no telling
When I feel like yelling, ""I love you""

Ooh, it gets lonely in the night
When there ain't no one around
Ooh, she makes me feel alright
Get my feet right off the ground

She's the girl of my dreams!
She's the girl of my dreams!

Judy does what I ask her to
She makes me happy when I feel blue
She stares with the eyes of a child
And gets me to my knees

Her heart, it never beats in time
'Cept when it's beating close to mine
I keep her from my friends
Locked away with my fantasies

And a man needs something
When he ain't got nothing to hang onto

507,18696,When The Feeling Comes Around,JENNIFER WARNES,1980,"We were walking in the sand I could feel your heart pound
A man and a woman, walking in the sundown
Maybe now I'll understand how you feel the way you do
We all have the same emotion, Baby I can feel it too

It's like the rocking of the ocean
The rolling of the sea
When the feeling comes around
When the feeling comes around

I have looked for love before
I was looking all around you
I'm not looking anymore
Now that I've found you, I've found you
When there's something deep inside
That tells me this is real
We're not just going through the motions this time
I know it's love we feel

Just like the rocking of the ocean
The rolling of the sea
When the feeling comes around
When the feeling comes around

It's like the rocking of the ocean
Like the rolling of the sea
When the feeling comes around
When the feeling comes around

It's like the rocking of the ocean
The rolling of the sea
When the feeling comes around
Lyrics courtesy Top40db.
When the feeling comes around

La la la da la la la
La la la da la

Like the rocking of the ocean
The rolling of the sea
When the feeling comes around
When the feeling comes around

It's like the rocking of the ocean
The rolling of the sea
When the feeling comes around
When the feeling comes around",4,2,3,5
508,18711,I Was Looking For Someone To Love,LEIF GARRETT,1980,"I told myself when you smiled at me
This time it's gonna be forever
I didn't know you would hurt me so
But from the very start
You are the one who would break my heart

Coz I was looking for someone to love
And oh the heartaches I found
I was looking for someone to love
But you were just looking around

You led me on pretending you could care
Promising the love we'd share together
I've closed the door, can't take it anymore
Love will never be the same
You turned it around and you made it a game

Repeat (2x)
Coz I was looking for someone to love
And oh the heartaches I found
I was looking for someone to love
But you were just looking around",3,6,2,2

All this talk is really useless
You run for cover
Everytime I'm close to you

There's something here we should discover
Let's make a little magic
Before the night is through

Oh, you've seen it all before
And heard the same lines,
But if you're willing to take a chance
It could be all right, so fine
We'll find ourselves dancing by firelight.

So don't you try to change the subject
Or try to put yourself above it,
A boy could get pneumonia sitting next to you
That's true

A little sleep is all we're losing
It's up to us to do the choosing
Let's make a little magic before the night is through
Make a little magic before the night is through

Ooh, to the blue skies
Where no one can reach us
It may sound crazy but just hold on tight,
Never has a love run deeper

Baby my heart is true

Let's make a little magic before the night is through",5,4,2,3

Who knows why
Someday we all must die
We're all homeless boys and girls
And we are never heard
It's such a lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely world
People turn their heads and walk on by
Tell me, is it worth just another try?

Light of the world, shine on me
Love is the answer (let it shine)
Shine on us all, set us free
Love is the answer (you know the answer is love)

Tell me, are we alive, or just a dying planet?
What are the chances?
Ask the man in your heart for the answers

And when you feel afraid, love one another
When you've lost your way, love one another
When you're all alone, love one another
When you're far from home, love one another
When you're down and out, love one another
All your hope's run out, love one another
When you need a friend, love one another
When you're near the end, love
We got to love, we got to love one another

Light of the world, you got to shine on me

Shine on us all (know that love can save the day)

Deny me from an Ivy school
Applyin' me to the street I slept
I quietly had to hold this tool
Reminding me of the block I repped
The turf I stepped, the church and the earth I blessed
The first I guessed the alert was the murk I chef
That hearse the flirt with perks of a kill confessed
Dispersed the worst, the first 48 addressed
The search and laws and verse of the birth I nest
The awe, the curse of a pose in zest
The good, the flaws, the pain to reverse what's left

You can say what you want
Not much you can do when the feeling is gone

I could see the city light
Wind was blowing, time stood still
Eagle flew out of the night
He was something to observe
Came in close, I heard a voice
Standing, stretching every nerve
Had to listen, had no choice
I did not believe the information
Just had to trust imagination
My heart going boom, boom, boom
""Son"", he said, ""grab your things, I've come to take you home""

To keep in silence I resigned
My friends would think I was a nut
Turning water into wine
Open doors would soon be shut
So I went from day to day
Though my life was in a rut
'Til I thought of what I'll say
Which connection I should cut
I was feeling part of the scenery
I walked right out of the machinery
My heart going boom, boom, boom
""Hey"", he said, ""grab your things, I've come to take you home""
(Hey, back home)

When illusion spin her net
I'm never where I want to be
And liberty she pirouette
When I think that I am free
Watched by empty silhouettes
Who close their eyes but still can see
No one taught them etiquette
I will show another me
Today I don't need a replacement
I'll tell them what the smile on my face meant
My heart going boom, boom, boom
""Hey"", I said, ""you can keep my things, they've come to take me home""",5,4,2,3

It happened forever, for a short time
A place for a moment, an end to dream
Forever I loved you, forever it seemed

[Chorus: x2]
One summer never ends, one summer never began
It keeps me standing still, it takes all my will
And then suddenly last summer
Sometimes I never leave, but sometimes I would
Sometimes I stay too long, sometimes I would
Sometimes it frightens me, sometimes it would
Sometimes I'm all alone and wish that I could

And then suddenly last summer

Like nothing I've ever known

Forget about long-range plans
'Cause this man's got his own

To get mixed up with a man who says never
May be big trouble, but then
I just could be the woman to take you
And make you never say never again

Never, never say never again
Never, never say never again
Never, never say never again
Never, never say never again

You've got all the moves
Ah, but baby I've got 'em too
No matter your attitude or your mood
I'll come through
The touch of your voice
The feel of your eyes on me
You leave me no choice
Though I know there's danger there
I don't care, let it be

To get it bad with a man who says never
May have no future, but then
I just could be the woman to reach you
And teach you to never say never again

I cried out, I am sick

Sick of hauling your love around
Want to run my train alone
But the engine tracks straight through your heart
And weighs me like a stone
Oh it's a hard love to love you it takes up all my time
Having you so familiar like past lives and nursery rhymes

So I gave away the pictures and your golden ring
And the phone calls you sent me and the silver birds that sing
Then the man he told me something that really brought me down
Your things were blown away it's true but you were still in town

[Chorus]

The magician left a message, it flashes when I hide
Accept the chains of loving,
Accept the rails remove yourself from her side
Do without her love

But the queens we use would not excite you

Dark shadows under long false lashes
The night exposes the cracks
She wears her makeup like wax
To hide every scratch
'Cause she a dark angel riding dark horses
Sitting pretty in her dim lit covers... I say
Black cars look better in the shade
She smears her lipstick on right before she sleeps
For all those phantom lovers in her dreams
She smokes them french cigarettes
In cocktail gloves and a strapless dress
She cuts a perfect silhouette
But she's a dark angel wearing dark glasses
A fading beauty as the night time passes... I say

There was a time when a boy would cry alone in his room
In the corner
And it's a crime that his toys would turn to stone
Like their original owners

At school they taught me how to be
So pure in thought and word and deed
They didn't quite succeed
For everything I long to do
No matter when or where or who
Has one thing in common, too

It's a, it's a, it's a, it's a sin
It's a sin
Everything I've ever done
Everything I ever do
Every place I've ever been
Everywhere I'm going to
It's a sin

Father, forgive me, I tried not to do it
Turned over a new leaf, then tore right through it
Whatever you taught me, I didn't believe it
Father, you fought me, 'cause I didn't care
And I still don't understand

So I look back upon my life
Forever with a sense of shame
I've always been the one to blame
For everything I long to do
No matter when or where or who
Has one thing in common, too

It's a, it's a, it's a, it's a sin
It's a sin
Everything I've ever done
Everything I ever do
Every place I've ever been
Everywhere I'm going to - it's a sin
It's a, it's a, it's a, it's a sin
It's a, it's a, it's a, it's a sin

589,22174,Learning To Fly,PINK FLOYD,1987,"Into the distance a ribbon of black
Stretched to the point of no turning back
A flight of fancy on a windswept field
Standing alone my senses reeled
A fatal attraction is holding me fast how
How can I escape this irresistible grasp?

Can't keep my eyes from the circling skies
Tongue tied and twisted just an earth bound misfit, I

Ice is forming on the tips of my wings
Unheeded warnings I thought I thought of everything
No navigator to find my way home
Unladened, empty and turned to stone

A soul in tension that's learning to fly
Condition grounded but determined to try
Can't keep my eyes from the circling skies
Tongue-tied and twisted just an earth-bound misfit, I

Friction lock, set
Mixtures, rich
Propellers, fully forward
Flaps, set, ten degrees
Engine gauges and suction, check

Mixture set to maximum percent, recheck
Flight instruments
Altimeters, check both
Navigation lights, on
Strobes, on
Confirm three-eight-echo ready for departure
Hello again, this is now 129.4
129.4, it's to go
You may commence your takeoff, winds over ten knots
Three-eight-echo
Easy on the brakes, take it easy, its gonna roll this time
Just hand the power gradually, and it

Above the planet on a wing and a prayer,
My grubby halo, a vapor trail in the empty air
Across the clouds I see my shadow fly
Out of the corner of my watering eye
A dream unthreatened by the morning light
Could blow this soul right through the roof of the night

There's no sensation to compare with this
Suspended animation, a state of bliss
Can't keep my mind from the circling skies
Tongue-tied and twisted just an earth-bound misfit, I",5,6,3,2

Birds and snakes, and aeroplanes
And Lenny Bruce is not afraid

Eye of a hurricane, listen to yourself churn
World serves its own needs
Don't mis-serve your own needs
Speed it up a notch, speed, grunt, no, strength
The ladder starts to clatter
With a fear of height, down, height
Wire in a fire, represent the seven games
And a government for hire and a combat site
Left her, wasn't coming in a hurry
With the Furies breathing down your neck

Team by team, reporters baffled, trumped, tethered, cropped
Look at that low plane, fine, then
Uh oh, overflow, population, common group
But it'll do, save yourself, serve yourself
World serves its own needs, listen to your heart bleed
Tell me with the Rapture and the reverent in the right, right
You vitriolic, patriotic, slam fight, bright light
Feeling pretty psyched

It's the end of the world as we know it
It's the end of the world as we know it

Six o'clock, T.V. hour, don't get caught in foreign tower
Slash and burn, return, listen to yourself churn
Lock him in uniform, book burning, bloodletting
Every motive escalate, automotive incinerate
Light a candle, light a motive, step down, step down
Watch your heel crush, crush, uh oh
This means no fear, cavalier, renegade and steering clear
A tournament, a tournament, a tournament of lies
Offer me solutions, offer me alternatives and I decline

I'm filled with all the joy I could find
You know that I
I'm not the desperate type
If there's one spark of hope
Left in my grasp
I'll hold it with both hands
It's worth the risk of burning
To have a second chance

No, no, no, no, no, no I need you baby
I still believe that we can be together, no no
If we believe that true love never has to end
Then we must know that we will love again.

And is seemed like nothing was going right
Then you turned around and you walked right out the door.

Now it's not the first time
It's not the last
I know all about your checkered past
And we've played this game one thousand times before.

Do you remember the night
I can see it so clear
All the sweet little things that you sang in my ear
There were promises made but I think you forgot what you said.

There's a real fine line between love and hate
And I'm not the type to just sit and wait
I've made up my mind
I can't wait for you anymore

But when we kiss
It feels like this
And when we touch
It means so much

So many days go by
And I still want you so
If it was up to me
I never let you go
You're the only true love in my life
And I want you to know

All this passion and pain
I think I'm going insane
We've got nothing to lose
And so much to gain
If you love me today
Who's to say you might leave me again?

Do you remember the night
I can see it so clear
All the sweet little things
That you sang in my ear
There were promises made but
I think you forgot what you said

With schemes of men, for days that lay ahead

To breed mistrust, it fills my heart with dread

And lose his life to war
Only confusion to this plan

Show me the love to keep us together
Open up your hearts don't turn me away
Comfort me through this stormy weather
From where I stand
I see a broken land

This boy has learned to fail
In times like these to cry seems so absurd
His own life's crisis pales
In the shadow of this truly dying world

Hail to the flag of blue and gold
And if you really care
Raise up your voice to let them know
They are not forsaken

Show me the love to keep us together
Open up your hearts don't turn me away
Comfort me through this stormy weather

603,22573,Every Rose Has Its Thorn,POISON,1988,"We both lie silently still
In the dead of the night
Although we both lie close together
We feel miles apart inside

Was it something I said or something I did
Did my words not come out right
Though I tried not to hurt you
Though I tried
But I guess that's why they say

Every rose has its thorn
Just like every night has its dawn
Just like every cowboy sings his sad, sad song
Every rose has its thorn
Yeah it does

I listen to her favorite song
Playing on the radio
Hear the DJ say loves a game of easy come and
Easy go
But I wonder does he know
Has he ever felt like this
And I know that you'd be here right now
If I could have let you know somehow I guess

Every rose has its thorn
Just like every night has its dawn
Just like every cowboy sings his sad, sad song
Every rose has its thorn

Though it's been a while now
I could still feel so much pain
Like the knife that cuts you the wound heals
But the scar, that scar remains

I know I could have saved a love that night
If I'd known what to say
Instead of makin' love
We both made our separate ways

And now I hear you found somebody new
And that I never meant that much to you
To hear that tears me up inside
And to see you cuts me like a knife I guess

Every rose has its thorn
Just like every night has its dawn
Just like every cowboy sings his sad, sad song
Every rose has its thorn",3,4,2,5

I didn't think much about it

Of what might happen at night

I couldn't stand to hear the
Crying of my mother
And I remember when
I swore that, that would be the
Last they'd see of me
And I never went home again

They say time is a healer
And new my wounds are not the same

You're no son, no son of mine
You're no son, no son of mine
You walked out, you left us behind
And you're no son, no son of mine

And what should I do

What would I do, if we passed on the street
Would I keep running away

In and out of hiding places
Soon I'd have to face the facts
We'd have to sit down and talk it over
And that would mean going back

I'm in that school of sharks, studying that Wu Tang
You like hakuna matata

638,23825,Peace Of Mind,ONE 2 ONE,1992,"Now of course I want peace on the streets, but realistically
Paintin' perfect pictures ain't never worked, my misery
Was so deep, couldn't sleep through all my pressures
In my quest for cash I learned fast, usin' violent measures
Memories of adolescent years, there was unity
But after puberty we brought war to our community
So many bodies droppin', it's gotta stop, I wanna help
But still I'm steppin', keep my weapon, must protect myself
The promise of a better tomorrow ain't never reached me
Plus my teachers was too petrified in class to teach me
Sippin' Thunderbird and grape Kool-Aid, callin' Earl
Since my stomach was empty, it seduced me to fuck the world
Watch my lil' homies lose they childhoods to guns
Nobody cries no more 'cause we all die for fun
So why you ask me if I want peace, if you can't grant it
Niggas fightin 'cross the whole planet, so it could never be peace

Will there ever be peace, or are we all just
Headed for doom, still consumed by the beast
And I know there'll never be peace (uh-uh)
That's why I keep my pistol when I walk the streets
'Cause there could never be peace

Somebody owes me, will they control me? Nah
I ain't a hater, player, but I want all you got
Y'all babies had babies now we fightin' each other
My dawgs got rabies, they bitin' each other
And it ain't hard to find a friend like mine
Bigfully is a bully and he don't mind dyin'
And I gotta be blind, missed sign after sign
Time after time, half the time, have the time
And I don't like nobody, they don't like me more
And I'm good with that finally but they heard it before
Dawg, we livin' in a prison, losin' our religion
On Thanksgiving, we thankful, just for livin' in hell
Damn, homie, I don't mean to be harsh
But there's a devil in the ghetto tryna tear it apart
And if we make it up out, we still stuck in the dark
Will there ever be peace? Just a piece of my heart, never

Yeah, the only peace we got, is the peace of our heart
Or peace of our mind, or that damn piece
That we hold in our waistline
You feel me, dawg? Come on, uh

So will there ever be peace, or are we all just
Headed for doom, still consumed by the beast
And I know, there'll never be peace (never)
That's why I keep my pistol when I walk the streets
'Cause there'll never be peace

Thangs is changin', nigga, you better read the signs
I'm only concerned about me and mine in these times
The world is a ghetto and peace is not a part of it
We all believe God's new plan to make it out of this
Niggas spendin' too much time hatin' on each other
Niggas buyin' guns, loadin' 'em up, aimin' at each other
And the victim is you and me, it's sick but it's true indeed
The good die, mostly over bullshit, repeatedly
Deep in me there's a part that wants nothin' but love
But the rest of me know war is what's waitin' for us
So I stays ready, keep my pay heavy and boss up
Stack my funds and my guns, never rely on luck
Asking God to point out the impostor
Never let no weapon formed against me prosper
'Cause there'll never be peace, so don't rely on it
Soldiers dyin' for it and in the ghetto
They're cryin' for it, but fuck peace

Will there ever be peace, or are we all just
Headed for doom, still consumed by the beast
And I know, there'll never be peace
That's why I keep my pistol when I walk the streets
Fool, there'll never be peace
Will there ever be peace, or are we all just
Headed for doom, still consumed by the beast
And I know, there'll never be peace
That's why I keep my pistol when I walk the streets
Nigga, there'll never be peace
Will there ever be peace, or are we all just
Headed for doom, still consumed by the beast
And I know, there'll never be peace
That's why I keep my pistol when I walks the streets
Nigga, there'll never be peace
Will there ever be peace?

Shit, fuck peace
On the strength 'til my niggas get a piece, we can't have peace
How the fuck we gon' live happy when we ain't got nuttin'?
You muthafuckas are smilin' but I'm mean muggin'
Why? 'Cause I gotta be thuggin'
It seems drugs done turned this whole muthafuckin' hood out
All us niggas actin' up, wild-ass, muthafuckin' adolescents
These niggas ain't even got no childhoods no more
How the fuck can you have a childhood?
And you at the funeral every muthafuckin' weekend?
Pssh, and you muthafuckas talkin' about peace
Nigga, it ain't no muthafuckin' peace
You ain't seen the news, muthafucka? You ain't heard?
Lil' babies gettin' smoked, muthafuckas killin' they whole family
Lil' kids gettin' thrown off buildings, muthafuckas gettin' abused
Peace? Nigga, is you out your fuckin' mind?
Fuck peace, we can't never have peace
'Til you muthafuckas clean up this mess you made
Till you fuckin' clean up the dirt you dropped
'Til we get a piece, fuck peace, Westside",5,7,2,3

Maybe hear some distant laughter
Look outside the hotel window
And my soul wanders off, babe
This is the town I met you in
And I won't soon forget that
Your proud beauty lingers on
Until the storm has lifted

Go find your fortune fast
It's cold outside but you'll make it

Leaving scars most of your life (nightmares can haunt you)

When you free your mind and let it float
Let me roll
We want your mind to blow
Just let us hang with you

Hanging in the hood, just shooting the breeze
My partners on the cut smoking swisher sweets
Tripping on the hoochies rolling by in they rides
Guzzling up a forty ounce of cold St. Ides
Jamming to a tape to my partner had made
""Growing up in the Hood"" being mixed with Face
Swisher sweet's a killer, feeling nothing but nice
Reached in my pocket for the old school dice
Pulled out a knot and dropped the dice on the floor
And asked my partner Mike what they hitting for
Pulled out a yard and said, ""We betting a dove""
Tee Lee Baby, show your partner some love
Kicking back fading, put the flame to the joint
3-2, drop baby, 3-2's your point
Back in the do' with a fo' and a ace
Picked up his ends and waved the dice in my face
And then he hollered out ""School house!""

Seen my partner, Big Chief and James
Creeping on the boulevard, acting a fool
Tripping on the broads at the old school
Music bumping hard, never turning it down
Trunk super tight with surround-by sound
Paint job cracking cause the punch ain't fade
Jamming that brand new 2Low tape
Windows all smokey, blowing coke-laced seed
I'm throwing up the deuce to the HPD
Now they looking crazy like I sold the hay
Just another day in the heart of S.A.
Roll a little further there, I seen O.G.
With his brother named, S.A. O.G.
They chopped up the hood, so I'm chunking it back
And then they pulled out a $200 sack
When I saw it I almost choked
Twist your partner one, big baby, just let your partner smoke

Smoking on some lovely, now I'm feeling fine
It's jumping off at the 9.9
5th Ward in the house with the S.A. fools
Ain't no set tripping cause we all so cool
Drinking up the bottle, getting drunk as a skunk
That 151 just ain't no punk
Hit the stage and grabbed the mic and started flexing styles
A stage full of tight MC's goin buckwild

650,24382,Never Should've Let You Go,HI-FIVE,1993,"Girl, when I first met you I didn't realize
You were looking to stay around
But I was looking to play around
Now I can't forget you
Can't forget your pretty smile
Took for granted the love you gave
And only thought of the love we made
Just when I found someone who could love me
Like the way that I need
I acted a fool and pushed her away from me

[CHORUS:]
And I'll be thinking 'bout you every night and every day
'Cause in my heart I'll know that I never should have let you go
And my love for you is stronger than I ever knew
But I couldn't tell you so that I never should have let you go
Do you think about me like I wasn't worth your time
I would give anything I have
If you give me another chance
Do you think you're better off without me
Playing games with your heart and mind, oh yeah
I don't blame you for leaving me
But now you gotta believe in me
If you come back, girl, I promise
That you'll see a change in my ways
I'll get down on my knees
I'll do anything you say

[CHORUS]
Is there someone else standing where I stood
Giving you the love you never got from me
Girl, I would give you the world if I only could
Girl, you will see
Will you come back to me
Won't you come back to me

[CHORUS]

And I'll be thinking 'bout you every night and every day
'Cause in my heart I'll know that I never should have let you go
And my love for you is stronger than I ever knew

No, I never should have let

Some say the blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice
I say the darker the flesh then the deeper the roots
I give a holler to my sisters on welfare
Tupac cares, if don't nobody else care
And uh, I know they like to beat ya down a lot
When you come around the block, brothas clown a lot
But please don't cry, dry your eyes, never let up
Forgive but don't forget, girl, keep your head up
And when he tells you you ain't nuttin' don't believe him
And if he can't learn to love you, you should leave him
'Cause sista you don't need him
And I ain't tryin' to gas ya up, I just call 'em how I see 'em (you don't need him)
You know me makes me unhappy? (What's that?)
When brothas make babies
And leave a young mother to be a pappy (oh, yeah, yeah, yeah)
And since we all came from a woman
Got our name from a woman and our game from a woman (yeah, yeah)
I wonder why we take from our women
Why we rape our women, do we hate our women? (Why? Why?)
I think it's time to kill for our women (why? Why? Why? Why?)
Time to heal our women, be real to our women
And if we don't we'll have a race of babies
That will hate the ladies, that make the babies (oh, yeah, baby)
And since a man can't make one
He has no right to tell a woman when and where to create one
So will the real men get up
I know you're fed up ladies, but keep your head up

Keep ya head up, ooh, child, things are gonna get easier
Keep-keep ya head up, ooh, child, things'll get brighter (ohh)

Keep ya head up, ooh, child, things are gonna get easier
Keep-keep ya head up, ooh, child, things'll get brighter

Ayo, I remember Marvin Gaye, used to sing to me
He had me feelin' like black was the thing to be
And suddenly the ghetto didn't seem so tough
And though we had it rough, we always had enough
I huffed and puffed about my curfew and broke the rules
Ran with the local crew, and had a smoke or two
And I realize momma really paid the price
She nearly gave her life, to raise me right (oh, yeah)
And all I had to give her was my pipe dream (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Of how I'd rock the mic, and make it to the bright screen
I'm tryin' to make a dollar out of fifteen cents
It's hard to be legit and still pay your rent
And in the end it seems I'm headin' for the pen
I try and find my friends, but they're blowin' in the wind
Last night my buddy lost his whole family
It's gonna take the man in me to conquer this insanity (no, no, no, no)
It seems the rain'll never let up
I try to keep my head up, and still keep from gettin' wet up
You know, it's funny when it rains it pours
They got money for wars, but can't feed the poor
Said it ain't no hope for the youth and the truth is
It ain't no hope for the future
And then they wonder why we crazy
I blame my mother for turning my brother into a crack baby
We ain't meant to survive, 'cause it's a setup
And even though you're fed up
Huh, ya got to keep your head up

Keep ya head up, ooh, child, things are gonna get easier
Keep-keep ya head up, ooh, child, things'll get brighter (oh)

Keep ya head up, ooh, child, things are gonna get easier
Keep-keep ya head up, ooh, child, things'll get brighter

And uh
To all the ladies havin' babies on they own
I know it's kinda rough and you're feelin' all alone
Daddy's long gone and he left you by ya lonesome
Thank the Lord for my kids, even if nobody else want 'em (left you all by yourself)
'Cause I think we can make it, in fact, I'm sure
And if you fall, stand tall and comeback for more
'Cause ain't nothin' worse than when your son
Wants to know why his daddy don't love him no mo'
You can't complain you was dealt this
Hell of a hand without a man, feelin' helpless
Because there's too many things for you to deal with
Dying inside, but outside you're looking fearless
While the tears is rollin' down your cheeks
Ya steady hopin' things don't all down this week
'Cause if it did, you couldn't take it, and don't blame me
I was given this world I didn't make it
And now my son's gettin' older and older and cold
From havin' the world on his shoulders
While the rich kids is drivin' Benz
I'm still tryin' to hold on to my survivin' friends
And it's crazy, it seems it'll never let up, but
Please, you got to keep your head up",7,1,7,7

A give me drank da bomb and let me get wit it.
Yeeyah, cause I'm gonna be the biggest pimp of the year
Goin' around doin' shit like this here.
Cause a nigga is strong,
And way to long when it comes to my ding dong.
But, bet, I get a check when I sign on the dotted line,
So now I know I gotta get mine.
It's really no thang to me, see, to be a real true P.I.M.P.
Cause I had me a hoe or two or mo'
Way back in eighty fuckin' fo'.
That's when I was a teen.
But my dick was still big to make a bitch bleed, see.
And of coarse I'm slappin' hoes,
smackin' hoes, up and down tha fuckin' avenues.
And ever I do that,
I dig a deep in the pocket for tha fat gat.
Feel me. I'm so god damn bad,
That I had to kick off in a hoe's ass,
Cause the girl tried to do me,
Ride of with her man in the mustang pony.
And I know it'd catch up with her
Next day in the paper, yeah the nigga raped her.
But I'm not trippin'.
Bitches like you want to keep on slippin'.
So I had to move on, to the next young bitch that had it goin' on
Ugh, and I'm not here to pump no fear,
I'm just the mack playa' pimp of the year, bitch.

Pimp, pimp on... You got all the ladies.

First thang first on the second verse.
I learned a hell of a lot,
A get from the get down start.
So I had my hoes hoin'.
Had every tramp thinkin' I was the orthidano goin'.
Cause all the game I spit is good shit,
And the shit that I spit made me rich.
Cause I was all about money.
If the girl says she down, well bees come and get the honey.
Cause I'm givin' it up quick.
Take a hit, take a lick at them pink lips.
Uh, and a bet is better than grey,
Not knowin' that I bought this broad out of state
And I met her in Mentley .
Lookin' just like the actress singer Whitney.
But I knew she was a fake one,
But to me young bra' it didn't really make me none.
I just walked up to her.
I said my name's Dru Down and I'll Slick Rick the ruler.
And from the get go,
I'm just a pimp, hoe, ya comin' with me, a to the east side O
And then she said okay,
I'm on my way, let me pack my bags before today.
Yeeyah, then I said get with it and don't be a bitch and try to split
Uh, She was right up under my wing ,
At the airport at five fifteen.
She said ""Who are you and why are ya here?"",
I said I'm Dru Down and pimp of the year.

Pimp, pimp on... You got all the ladies.
Pimp, pimp on... You got all the ladies.

I've got a thang for makin' hoes.
Every woman that I touch bitch turns into gold.
And I don't go for talk back,
Have respect when ya speakin' to a pimp fuck that.
Deduct from tha pay check,
Matta fact get yo ass in the back of the Cadillac,
So I can ride and check mate.
Like rule number eight I keep a bitch in a plate.
And no I don't play around, fuck around,
A when it comes to my money nigga.
And when it comes to gettin' a bitch sprung,
I give her Henesee, a with tha one on one.
So she can get so high, real high,
And that she that knows I'm that type a guy.
Cause I'm a kick somethin' just for the hoes,
And for myself I keep indo.
And when a hoe finds out I'm real, yes I am
Mack playa pimp of tha year.

Just barely alive

The night they drove old Dixie down

And all the people were singing
They went ""La la la la la la, la la la la la la la la la""

Back with my wife in Tennessee
One day she came to me
""Virgil, Look, come see! There goes Robert E. Lee!""
Well I don't mind chopping wood
And I don't care if the money's no good
But you take what you need and leave the rest
And they should never have taken the very best

The night they drove old Dixie down
And all the bells were ringing
The night they drove old Dixie down
And all the people were singing
They went ""La la la la la la, la la la la la la la la la""

Like my father before me
I am a working man
And like my brother above me
I took a rebel stand
He was just eighteen
Proud and brave
But a Yankee laid him in his grave
I swear by the blood beneath my feet
You can't raise the cane back up when it's in defeat

The night they drove old Dixie down
And all the bells were ringing
The night they drove old Dixie down
And all the people were singing

That's when the energy comes
And the dark side's light
And the vampires roam
You strut your rasta wear
And your suicide poem
And a cross from a faith that died
Before Jesus came
You're building a mystery

You live in a church
Where you sleep with voodoo dolls
And you won't give up the search
For the ghosts in the halls
You wear sandals in the snow
And a smile that won't wash away
Can you look out the window
Without your shadow getting in the way?

You're so beautiful
With an edge and charm
But so careful
When I'm in your arms

'Cause you're working

A prayer from your secret God
You feed off our fears
And hold back your tears, oh

And a know-it-all grin
Just when we need one
When the evening's thin

Can separate the mountains from the sea

Spent so many nights believing I was wrong for you bein in my life
I can't ignore it when some say that it ain't right

Ain't no if's, no and's, no but's or no maybe's
The vibe'll drive you crazy, almost break your neck
Again we take respect, remember Just To Get A Rep?
Sportin' baggy pants, mackin' stackin' finance
Bold figure, older nigga, yo watch me advance
Used to be a small cat, now I'm all that and more
Puttin' the pressure on, catchin' rep from the dog
Pure secure, injectin' like the fuckin' doctors
Smoother than silk, more milk than Louie Pasteur
Ask yourself, ""Do you wanna mess wit this?""
The specialist, turn the page, I bring the rage when I spit
Then the set gets wet, I bring the crowd into a frenzy
Leave you sleepin' wit the fishes, see how them niggas envy
Authentic vocal tone, transmittin' like a mobile phone
Welcome to my ghetto my man, hope you can hold your own
I make you first name To The, last name Curb
I gets grimy, stimey, who you? Revenge of the herbs
I ain't seen you out here, and you ain't got no clout here
Your style don't come across, you lost this bout here

Now wouldn't you agree, that the three of us put together
Make it mo' better to make mo' cheddar
Puffin get higher than four centers
Ask Coretta, Scott King on the spot
Who's the Doc like that man uh, Mart King
Keep march-ing, 'cause when it comes to me and The Guru
Like my man Charlie Brown said, the rest of y'all is doo-doo

Tell you to your face, you ain't nuttin' but a faker

Possible overdose, substance unknown
Pulse is 60 and thready, respiration's eight
He's intubated and we're bagging him now
Uh, BP 90 over palp, patient is cool, pale, and diaphoretic
Has aspirated, uh, GSC is 3
Will update en route, ETA, ten minutes

As I fall deeper into a manic state
I'm a prime candidate for the gene to receive the drug addict trait
Blood pressure climbs at a dramatic rate
I seem to gravitate to the bottle of NyQuil then I salivate
Start off with the NyQuil, like, ""I think I'll just have a taste""
Couple of sips of that then I gradually graduate
To a harder prescription drug called Valium, like, ""Yeah, that's great""
I go to just take one and I end up like having eight
Now I need something in my stomach 'cause I haven't ate
Maybe I'll grab a plate of nachos and I'll have a steak
And you'd think that with all I have at stake
Look at my daughter's face
""Mommy, something is wrong with dad I think
He's acting weird again, he's really beginning to scare me
Won't shave his beard again and he pretends he doesn't hear me
And all he does is eat Doritos and Cheetos
And he just fell asleep in his car eating 3 Musketeers in the rear seat""

Sometimes I feel so alone, I just don't know
Feels like I been down this road before
So lonely and cold, it's like something takes over me
As soon as I go home and close the door
Kinda feels like déjà vu
I wanna get away from this place, I do
But I can't and I won't, say I try, but I know that's a lie
'Cause I don't and why, I just don't know

""Maybe just a nice cold brew, what's a beer?""
That's the devil in my ear, I've been sober a fuckin' year
And that fucker still talks to me, he's all I can fuckin' hear
""Marshall, come on, we'll watch the game
It's the Cowboys and Buccaneers""
And maybe if I just drink half, I'll be half-buzzed
For half of the time, who's the mastermind behind that little line?
With that kind of rationale, man, I got half a mind
To have another half a glass of wine, sounds asinine
Yeah, I know, but I never had no problem with alcohol
Ouch, look out for the wall, aim for the couch, I'm 'bout to fall
I miss the couch and down I go, lookin' like a bouncy ball
Shit must've knocked me out 'cause I ain't feel the ground at all
Wow, what the fuck happened last night? Where am I?
Man, fuck, am I hungover, and goddamn, I
Got a headache, shit, half a Vicodin, why can't I?
All systems ready for take off, please stand by

Sometimes I feel so alone, I just don't know
Feels like I been down this road before
So lonely and cold, it's like something takes over me
As soon as I go home and close the door
Kinda feels like déjà vu
I wanna get away from this place, I do
But I can't and I won't, say I try, but I know that's a lie
'Cause I don't and why, I just don't know

So I take a Vicodin, splash, it hits my stomach, then, ah
Couple of weeks go by, it ain't even like I'm gettin' high
Now I need it just not to feel sick, yeah, I'm gettin' by
Wouldn't even be taking this shit if DeShaun didn't die
Oh yeah, there's an excuse, you lose Proof so you use
There's new rules, it's cool if it's helpin' you to get through
It's twelve noon, ain't no harm in self-inducin' a snooze
What else is new? Fuck it, what would Elvis do in your shoes?
Now here I am three months later, full-blown relapse
""Just get high until the kids get home from school, homes, relax""
And since I'm convinced that I'm an insomniac
I need these pills to be able to sleep, so I take three naps
Just to be able to function throughout the day, let's see
That's an Ambien each nap, how many Valium? Three?
And that will average out to about one good hour's sleep
Okay, so now ya see the reason how come he
Has taken four years to just put out an album, B
See, me and you, we almost had the same outcome, Heath
'Cause that Christmas, you know the whole pneumonia thing?
It was bologna, was it the methadone, ya think?
Or the hydrocodone you hide inside your pornos?
Your VCR tape cases, with your Ambien CR
Great places to hide 'em, ain't it? So you can lie to Hailie
I'm going beddy-bye, Whitney, baby, good night, Alaina
Go in the room and shut the bedroom door
And wake up in an ambulance
They said they found me on the bathroom floor, damn

Sometimes I feel so alone, I just don't know
Feels like I been down this road before
So lonely and cold, it's like something takes over me
As soon as I go home and close the door

I hear your heartbeat
Just go on for miles
And suddenly I know
My life is worth while
That's what I see
Through your eyes

Here in the night
I see the sun
Here in the dark
Our two hearts are one
It's out of our hands
We can't stop what we have begun
And love just took me by surprise
Looking through your eyes

I look at myself
And instead I see us
Whoever I am now
It feels like enough
And I see a girl
Who is learning to trust
That's who I see through your eyes

Here in the night

With clowns and freaks and camels and such
And you never know when you might be attacked by the bears

Give me love, give me love, love me good

I'm afraid of my own shadow and then
Sometimes I can feel as bold as Genghis Khan
But I could never live in a yurt
On a diet of Mongolian barbecue
I conquer the world for a moment, then the moment is gone

Chorus

Bridge:

Let us take a moment now to bow our heads and pray
If only to give thanks for making it through another day

Sometimes I wish I was in a movie
Or some 70's TV thing
Where everything gets neatly wrapped by the end of the show

And this sure ain't the Brady Bunch
And how this plot's gonna all pan out, I don't really know

We called him freckled faced red headed fool
He was different he wasn't cool like me
Sticks and stones didn't break any bones
Bet we never left well enough alone
And one day he ran away from home you see
And I passed him as he walked away
And in his eyes I heard him say
""One of these days you're gonna love me
You'll sit down by yourself and think
About the times you pushed and shoved me
And what good friends we might've been
And then you're gonna sigh a little
Maybe even cry a little but
One of these days you're gonna love me""

Patty Sue was a small town beauty
I took one look at her and had to pull her to me
Lord knows she should've seen right through me
When I promised her the world
But at seventeen, you only want one thing
I left her standin' there with my high school ring
Innocent tears in the pourin' rain
As I walked away
And I still see her in my dreams
And to this day she's whispering

""One of these days you're gonna love me
You'll sit down by yourself and think
About the time you turned from me
And what good friends we might've been
And then you're gonna sigh a little
Maybe even cry a little but
One of these days you're gonna love me""

Now everybody stands up
The congregation sings
It's a song of sweet forgiveness
And as the chorus rings
The wind blows clear my memory
The pages start to turn
Then suddenly I'm singin'
The moment that I learn

One of these days I'm gonna love me
And feel the joy of sweet release
One of these days, I'll rise above me
And at last I'll find some peace
Then I'm gonna smile a little
Maybe even laugh a little but
One of these days I'm gonna love me",5,4,3,6

Not like before
Yesterday I saw your smilin' face
Love walked through my door

One precious moment
Changed my life
One tender kiss
Made everything right

One touch from you
And this world was mine
It was in your arms where I found forever

[Chorus]
Cried my first tears of joy last night
Heaven shined a light
All my dreams came true
My first night with you
I felt the sun
Shine so bright on me
Chased the rain from my heart
Through the storm
Through the darkest night
I found my brightest star
One magic moment
Made one magic night

I fell in love
With one look in your eyes baby
I never knew I could feel so loved
Darling, in your arms
I could feel forever

[Chorus]

One precious moment
Changed my life
One tender kiss
Made everything right

One touch from you
And this world was mine
It was in your arms babe
Where I found forever and ever

Classic cars were his thing
When I pulled in the drive with that old 'vette

We're not zoned in till it was new again
And as he sat behind the wheel

Baby I don't love her
You don't love me
You know what I don't even want to talk to you
She don't mean nothing to me

I don't want to see ya face
I just want to see you walking thourgh that door
There ain't nothing else to say
Peace

Come home late
It seems you barely beat the sun
Tapping my shoulder thinking you gon get you some
Smelling like some fragrance that I don't even wear
If you want some loving I suggest you go back there where you came from

Day to Day with you it's always something else
Working my nerve God knows I don't deserve
What you put me through cause I been so true to you
For you to come at me with another lame excuse
See I .....

Heard it all before (heard it all before)
All of ya lies, all of ya sweet talk
Baby this, Baby that
But your lies ain't working now look who's hurting now

Yes I did yes I did
But your lies ain't working now look who's hurting now
See I had to shut you down (I had to shut you down)

What were you thinking bringing her into our home
In our bed, you must have fell and bumped your head
Messing up my sheets and violating me
Have me bout to call my peeps and take it to the streets
Nothing you can do

And there's nothing you can say
That would persuade me to stay with you another day
You have crossed the line to the point of no return
What you do from here on out
I am no longer concerned
See I...

But your lies ain't working now look who's hurting now
See I had to shut you down (I had to shut you down)

Use to hang on to your every word

The wicked lies we tell to keep us safe from the pain
Will I hold you again?

Like will it rain today
We waste the hours with talking talking
These twisted games we're playing
We're strange allies
With warring hearts
What a wild-eyed beast you be

The wicked lies we tell that hope to keep us safe from the pain
Look at us spinning out in the madness of a roller coaster
You know you went off like the devil in the church
In the middle of a crowded room
All we can do my love

Is hope we don't take this ship down

Where you smile and hide
Is where you'll find me if I get to go
The space between
The bullets in our firefight
Is where I'll be hiding waiting for you

The rain that falls
Splashed in your heart
Ran like sadness down the window into your room

Our wicked lies is
The hope to keep us safe from pain

Take my hand

Treat you like a real woman should

I gave him a gentle shake

I said, ""Old man are you ok?""

Drip dryin' in the summer breeze

Past a field of hay that had just been mowed

'Bout the time he grabbed my arm
When I heard momma holler, son hurry up
I was close enough for my own nose
To smell fresh cobbler on the stove
And I saw daddy loadin' up the truck
Cane poles on the tailgate
Bobbers blowin' in the wind
Since July of '55

Indeed I need not take no lie
Man, ya'll gonna make me cry
It's kinda eerie when you hear me

I give a little bit, and she fiend for more (lets go)

Fans from Iran and Singapore
And grown men beg me to bring them on tour
Even if it mean they gotta sleep on the floor (Let's Go!!)

I used to be the guy stood next to Diddy
Crucified for bringin sex in the city
Even though the girls think I'm extra pretty
How I know? I ain't got no extra wit me, oh
With the fist tight flow
Wit a wrist like whoa
What if this might blow
Ain't no if I...Know
I'm the man to plan the way

Hate the game, but it made a man a man

He's usually up to his chest in oil and grease
There's the Martins walkin' in
With that mean little freckle-faced kid
Who broke a window last week
Sweet Miss Betty likes to sing off key
In the pew behind me

That's what I love about Sunday
Sing along as the choir sways
Every verse of Amazing Grace
And then we shake the preacher's hand
Go home into your blue jeans
Have some chicken and some baked beans
Pick a backyard football team
Not do much of anything
That's what I love about Sunday

I stroll to the end of the drive
Pick up the Sunday Times, grab a coffee cup
Looks like Sally and Rob finally tied the knot
Well, it's about time
It's thirty-five cents off a ground round
Baby, cut that coupon out

That's what I love about Sunday
Cat-nappin' on a porch swing
You curled up next to me
The smell of jasmine wakes us up
Take a walk down a back road
Tackle box and a cane pole
Carve our names in that white oak
I steal a kiss as the sun fades
That's what I love about Sunday, aw yeah

New believers bein' baptized
Mama's hands raised up high
Havin' a hallelujah good time
A smile on everybody's face

751,28055,Trapped In The Closet (Chapter 1 Of 5),R. KELLY,2005,"Seven o'clock in the morning
And the rays from the sun wakes me
I'm stretchin' and yawnin'
In a bed that don't belong to me
And a voice yells, ""Good morning, darlin"", from the bathroom
Then she comes out and kisses me
And to my surprise, she ain't you

Now I've got this dumb look on my face
Like, what have I done?
How could I be so stupid to be have laid here til the morning sun?
Lost the track of time
Oh, what was on my mind?
From the club, went to her home
Didn't plan to stay that long

Here I am, quickly tryin' to put on my clothes
Searching for my car keys
Tryin' to get on up out the door
Then she stretched her hands in front of it
Said, ""You can't go this way""
Looked at her, like she was crazy
Said, ""Woman move out my way""
Said, ""I got a wife at home""
She said, ""Please don't go out there""
""Lady, I've got to get home""
She said, her husband was comin' up the stairs

""Shh, shh, quiet
Hurry up and get in the closet""
She said, ""Don't you make a sound
Or some shit is going down""
I said, ""Why don't I just go out the window?""
""Yes, except for one thing, we on the 5th floor""
""Shit think, shit think, shit quick, put me in the closet""
And now I'm in this darkest closet, tryin' to figure out
Just how I'm gonna get my crazy ass up out this house

Then he walks in and yells, ""I'm home""
She says, ""Honey, I'm in the room""
Walks in there with a smile on his face
Sayin', ""Honey, I've been missin' you""
She hops all over him
And says, ""I've cooked and ran your bath water?
I'm tellin' you now, this girl's so good that she deserves an Oscar

Throws her in the bed
And start to snatchin' her clothes off
I'm in the closet, like man, what the fuck is going on?
You're not gonna believe it
But things get deeper as the story goes on
Next thing you know, a call comes through on my cell phone
I tried my best to quickly put it on vibrate
But from the way he act, I could tell it was too late
He hopped up and said, ""There's a mystery going on
And I'm gonna solve it""
And I'm like, ""God please, don't let this man open this closet?

He walks in the bathroom
And looks behind the door
She says, ""Baby, come back to bed""
He says, ""Bitch say no more""
He pulls back the shower curtain
While she's biting her nails
Then he walks back to the room
Right now, I'm sweating like hell
Checks under the bed
Then under the dresser
He looks at the closet
I pull out my Beretta
He walks up to the closet
He goes up to the closet
Now he's at the closet
Damn he's opening the closet?",4,7,1,2

Finished if who we are incomplete

Taste the milk of your mother earth's love
Spread the word of consciousness you see

Kick, push, kick, push, coast
And away he rolled
Jus' a rebel to the world with no place to go
And so he kick, push, kick, push
Kick, push, kick, push, coast
So come and skate with me
Just a rebel looking for a place to be
So let's kick
And push
And coast

My man got a little older, became a better a roller
Yeah, no helmet, hell bent on killing himself
Is what his momma said but he was feeling himself
Got a little more swagger in his style
Met his girlfriend, she was clapping in the crowd
Love is what was happening to him now, uh
He said ""I would marry you
But I'm engaged to these aerials and varials
And I don't think this board is strong enough to carry two""
She said ""Bow, I weigh a hundred and twenty pounds
Now, let me make one thing clear
I don't need to ride yours, I got mine right here""
So she took him to a spot he didn't know about
Some modern apartment parking lot
She said ""I don't normally take dates in here""
Security came and said ""I'm sorry, there's no skating here""

And so they kick, push, kick, push
Kick, push, kick, push, coast
And away they rolled
Just lovers intertwined with no place to go
And so they kick, push, kick, push
Kick, push, kick, push, coast
So come and skate with me
Just a rebel, looking for a place to be
So let's kick
And push
And coast

Yeah, uh (swanky)
Yeah, yeah

Before he knew, he had a crew that wasn't no punk
In they Spitfire shirts and SB dunks
They would push 'til they couldn't skate no more
Office building lobbies wasn't safe no more
And it wasn't like they wasn't getting chased no more
Just the freedom was better than breathing they said (they said)
An escape route they used to escape out
When things got crazy, they needed to break out
They head to any place with stairs
Any good grinds, the world was theirs, uh
And they four wheels would take 'em there
Until the cops came and said ""There's no skating here""

And so they kick, push, kick, push
Kick, push, kick, push, coast
And away they rolled
Just rebels without a cause with no place to go
And so they kick, push, kick, push
Kick, push, kick, push, coast
So come roll with me
Just a rebel looking for a place to be

The Bible lives by the bed
And she's lied alone so many nights
With scriptures in her head

And he's come close to goin' way too far a few times

From T-Ball to touchdowns
Fixed my car and fixed my heart

Will snatch him away from his lady
No matter how hard the man hold back

You had him crawlin' on hands and knees

Last night in the cafe I wanted to hold your hand
So I told you with my eyes that I understand
That life sure ain't easy here in this no-man's land
I got to find ol' Joe before he loses it all

Somewhere I believe there's a place for me
Down the road to destiny
Can you hear that eagle call?
I got to find ol' Joe before he loses it all

The dogs go to barkin' at the risin' of the moon
And the highway's a-callin and I'll be listin' soon
Another weary rambler crazy as a loon
I got to find ol' Joe before he loses it all

The motel up ahead has a vacancy sign
But I'm travelin' too hard to pay it any mind
There's a rainbow in the clouds down ol' Highway 99
I gotta find ol' Joe before he loses it all

Somewhere I believe there's a place for me
Down the road to destiny
Can you hear that eagle call?
I got to find ol' Joe before he loses it all

The Wild West was made with the blood of the brave
Where there was little to take and even less to save
Where they buried their heroes in unmarked graves
I got to find ol' Joe before he loses it all

You work all your life to get where you are
Then you throw it all away to chase some crazy star
While the prophet on the radio slings his guitar
I got to find ol' Joe before he loses it all

Somewhere I believe there's a place for me
Down the road to destiny
Can you hear that eagle call?

Where they buried their heroes in unmarked graves

Caught somewhere between a boy and man

She was seventeen and she was far from in-between

It was summertime in Northern Michigan

Splashing through the sand bar, talking by the campfire

It's the simple things in life like when and where

We didn't have no Internet but man I never will forget

The way the moonlight shined upon her hair

And we were trying different things, we were smoking funny things

Making love out by the lake to our favorite song

Sipping whiskey out the bottle, not thinking 'bout tomorrow

Singing 'Sweet Home Alabama' all summer long

Singing 'Sweet Home Alabama' all summer long

Catching Walleye from the dock

Watching the waves roll off the rocks

She'll forever hold a spot inside my soul

We'd blister in the sun, we couldn't wait for night to come

To hit that sand and play some rock 'n' roll

While we were trying different things

And we were smoking funny things

Making love out by the lake to our favorite song

Sipping whiskey out the bottle, not thinking 'bout tomorrow

Singing 'Sweet Home Alabama' all summer long

Singing 'Sweet Home Alabama' all summer

Now nothing seems as strange as

When the leaves began to change

Or how we thought those days would never end

Sometimes I hear that song and I'll start to sing along

And think, man, I'd love to see that girl again

Man, I'd like to see that girl again

And we were trying different things and we were smoking funny things

Making love out by the lake to our favorite song

Sipping whiskey out the bottle, not thinking 'bout tomorrow

Just get you a guitar and learn how to play
Cut up some jeans, come up with a name
When you're living in a world that you don't understand
Find a few good buddies, start a band
Start a band, start a band

And all those girls that were too cool to talk to,
They'll be waiting in the line out back
Might get your picture in the hometown paper
Maybe buy your momma that Cadillac

Cut up some jeans, come up with a name
When you're living in a world that you don't understand
Find a few good buddies, start a band

Start a band, scrape up some money, buy a van
Learn 'Free Bird' and 'Ramblin' Man'
Never buy another beer again

So get you a guitar and learn how to play

You are now free to smoke about the cabin, cabin

I'm Dre from back in the day, from
N.W.A, from black and the gray, from
Choking a bitch to smacking her face, from
Stacking up bodies to
Racking AKs up, from
Racking up hits to
Stacking them crates up
I'm still hungry and I'm back with a tapeworm
And we're what's happening in rap entertainment
Me and Shady, far as competition, faggot, there ain't none (yeah)

Speak of the Devil
It's attack of the rain man
Chainsaw in hand, blood stain on my apron
Soon as the blade spun, vrrun, they run away from
Who wanna play dungeon?
No one is safe from
In search of a brain surgeon, a great one
Wait, it ain't funny, man
It's urgent, I need one
Two boxes of detergent and a paint gun
And an emergency squirt gun to spray A-1

So one more time for old time's sake
Dre, drop that beat and scratch that break
Now just blow a little bit of that smoke my way
And let's go
(You are now smoking with the best, the best)
I said one more time for old time's sake
Dre, drop that beat and scratch that break
Now just send a little bit of that smoke my way
And let's go
(You are now smoking with the best, the best)

Smoke signal in the sky like Verizon wireless
A nice environment, surprised entirely
Hypnotized by the sound I surround
The hydrants taking lives of firemen
Say goodbye, here I am again
Naked wives and Vicodin
Before I begin to get so high, pussy boy, I could spin
Fin, fin, fuck the handle, I fly off the hinge
Let that boy off the bench, coach, and throw it to him
There he goes in his trench coat, no clothes again
Baby, make us some French toast and show us some skin
I'll show you every inch grows on my foreskin
Show me nipple, I pinch both, and throw up a ten
Now you know it's a sin to tease, blow us again
The sorcerer of intercourse, if it's forced, it's him
Don't fight the feeling if you're feeling the force within
And when you wake up in the morning next to the porcelain

So one more time for old time's sake
Dre, drop that beat and scratch that brake
Now just blow a little bit of that smoke my way
And let's go
(You are now smoking with the best, the best)
I said one more time for old time's sake
Dre, drop that beat and scratch that brake
Now just send a little bit of that smoke my way
And let's go

Now where there's smoke, there's fire
Where there's fire, there's flames
Where there's flames, there's chronic
Either you high or you ain't
I got no time for no games

Nah-uh, he ain't playin'
He's gon' get the AK
And aim it right at your brain
I'm slightly insane, Vodka and creatine
Hypnotic and Red Bull, it's an incredible energy drink
And it's given me wings, I believe I can fly
While I pee on a girl, you won't catch me, CSI
It's as easy as pie and as simple as cake
Dre, get on the mic and make 'em tremble and shake

Now put your smoke up in the air
Raise your Henny and Coke
And if you really wanna get fucked up, just let me know
We can smoke 'til there's no more lighter fluid to do it
Let's get into it
You're smoking with the triedest and truest
I got the Midas touch when it comes to rolling shit up
You motherfuckers ain't smoking, you just holding shit up
Now here we go
Let's get up, get down, hold up a blunt
I smoke the kinda stuff that make the records go number one
'Cause if at first you don't succeed, won't hurt to smoke some weed
Now them words are just a little more personal for me
Seeing is how I blew up off of puffing them trees

Well smoke enough for me
Fuck yeah, light it up, Cheech
Come on, smoke me out, cuz, give me contact buzz
Get me on track, they love me when I'm on that stuff
But this is earth calling Shady, man come on back (what?)
Man, we're losing him, he won't even respond back, fuck
Now look at all the pretty women in here (damn, bitches)
Dre, it's hot, I think we better go check on their temperatures
I'll get the thermometer, you get the bandages
Now, baby, just bend over, this won't hurt a damn bit, just

And give me one more time for old time's sake
Dre, drop that beat and scratch that break
Now just blow a little bit of that smoke my way

I never thought that I'd ever say
We're halfway there
We're halfway there

When the chips are down
Back against the wall
Got no more to give
'Cause we gave it all
Seems like going a distance is unrealistic
But we're too far from the start

So we take what comes, And we keep on going
Leaning on each other's shoulders
Then we turn around
And see we've come so far somehow

We're halfway there
We're looking good now
And nothing's gonna get in the way
We're halfway there
And looking back now
I never thought that I'd ever say
We're halfway there
We're halfway there

How you ever gonna reach the stars
If you never get off the ground
And you'll always be where you are
If you let life knock you down

We're halfway there
We're looking good now
And nothing's gonna get in the way
We're halfway there
And looking back now
I never thought that I'd ever say
We're halfway there

Ice ice baby
Ice ice baby
All right stop
Collaborate and listen
Ice is back with my brand new invention
Something grabs a hold of me tightly
Flow like a harpoon daily and nightly
Will it ever stop?
Yo, I don't know
Turn off the lights, ha, and I'll glow
To the extreme, I rock a mic like a vandal
Light up a stage and wax a chump like a candle

Dance
Go rush the speaker that booms
I'm killin' your brain like a poisonous mushroom
Deadly, when I play a dope melody
Anything less than the best is a felony
Love it or leave it
You better gain way
You better hit the bull's eye
The kid don't play
If there was a problem
Yo, I'll solve it
Check out the hook while my DJ revolves it

Ice ice baby, Vanilla
Ice ice baby, Vanilla
Ice ice baby, Vanilla
Ice ice baby

Now that the party is jumping
With the bass kicked in, and the Vegas are pumpin'
Quick to the point, to the point no faking
I'm cooking MC's like a pound of bacon
Burning 'em if, if you ain't quick and nimble
I go crazy when I hear a cymbal
And a hi hat with a souped up tempo
I'm on a roll and it's time to go solo
Rollin' in my 5.0
With my ragtop down so my hair can blow
The girlies on standby
Waving just to say, ""Hi""
Did you stop?
No, I just drove by
Kept on pursuing to the next stop
I bust a left and I'm heading to the next block
That block was dead

Yo so I continued to A1A Beachfront Avenue
Girls were hot wearing less than bikinis
Rockman lovers driving Lamborghini's
Jealous 'cause I'm out getting mine
Shay with a gauge and Vanilla with a nine
Ready for the chumps on the wall
The chumps are acting ill because they're so full of eight ball
Gunshots ranged out like a bell
I grabbed my nine
All I heard were shells
Fallin' on the concrete real fast
Jumped in my car, slammed on the gas
Bumper to bumper the avenue's packed
I'm tryin' to get away before the jackers jack
Police on the scene
You know what I mean?
They passed me up, confronted all the dope fiends
If there was a problem
Yo, I'll solve it
Check out the hook while my DJ revolves it

Ice ice baby, Vanilla
Ice ice baby, Vanilla
Ice ice baby, Vanilla
Ice ice baby

Take heed, 'cause I'm a lyrical poet
Miami's on the scene just in case you didn't know it
My town, that created all the bass sound
Enough to shake and kick holes in the ground
'Cause my style's like a chemical spill
Feasible rhymes you can vision and feel
Conducted and formed
That's a hell of a concept
We make it hype and you want to step with this
Shay plays on the fade, slice like a ninja
Cut like a razor blade so fast
Other DJ's say, ""Damn""
If my rhyme was a drug
I'd sell it by the gram
Keep my composure when it's time to get loose
Magnetized by the mic while I kick my juice
If there was a problem
Yo, I'll solve it!
Check out the hook while my DJ revolves it

Ice ice baby, Vanilla

Help me to face what lies ahead

They'd probably gun me down by the end of this song
Seem like the whole city go against me
Every time I'm in the street I hear

""Yawk! Yawk! Yawk! Yawk!""

""Man down
Where you from, nigga?""
""Fuck who you know, where you from, my nigga?""
""Where your grandma stay, huh, my nigga?""
""This m.A.a.d city I run, my nigga""

Brace yourself, I'll take you on a trip down memory lane
This is not a rap on how I'm slingin crack or move cocaine
This is cul-de-sac and plenty Cognac and major pain
Not the drill sergeant, but the stress that weighing on your brain
It was me, L Boog, and Yan Yan, YG Lucky ride down Rosecrans
It got ugly, waving your hand out the window, check yo self
Uh, Warriors and Conans
Hope euphoria can slow dance with society
The driver seat the first one to get killed
Seen a light-skinned nigga with his brains blown out
At the same burger stand where-, hang out
Now this is not a tape recording saying that he did it
But ever since that day, I was lookin' at him different
That was back when I was nine
Joey packed the nine
Pakistan on every porch is fine
We adapt to crime, pack a van with four guns at a time
With the sliding door, fuck is up?
Fuck you shootin' for if you ain't walkin up you fuckin' punk?
Pickin' up the fuckin' pump
Pickin' off you suckers, suck a dick or die or sucker punch
A wall of bullets comin' from
Ak's, AR's, ""Aye y'all. Duck""
That's what momma said when we was eatin' that free lunch
Aw man, God damn, all hell broke loose
You killed my cousin back in '94, fuck yo' truce
Now crawl yo' head in that noose
You wind up dead on the news
Ain't no peace treaty, just piecin'
Bgs up to pre-approve, bodies on top of bodies
Iv's on top of IV's
Obviously the coroner between the sheets like the Isleys
When you hop on that trolley
Make sure your color's correct
Make sure you're corporate, or they'll be calling your mother collect
They say the governor collect, all of our taxes except
When we in traffic and tragic happens, that shit ain't no threat
You movin' backwards if you suggest that you sleep with a TEC
Go buy a chopper and have a doctor on speed dial, I guess

Hood ('sup, cuz? Wassup? nah, nah, nah, fuck that, nah)
Ain't nothin but a Compton thang
Chyea (we got five on it)
How we do

Fresh outta school 'cause I was a high school grad
Sleeping in the living room of my momma's pad
Reality struck I seen the white car crash
Hit the light pole two nigga's hopped out on foot and dashed (watch out cuz)
My Pops said I needed a job I thought I believed him
Security guard for a month and ended up leaving
In fact I got fired 'cause I was inspired by all of my friends
To stage a robbery the third Saturday I clocked in
Projects tore up, gang signs get thrown up (wassup?)
Cocaine laced in marijuana
And they wonder why I rarely smoke now
Imagine if your first blunt had you foaming at the mouth
I was straight tweaking the next weekend we broke even
I made allegiance that made a promise to see you bleeding
You know the reasons but still won't ever know my life
Kendrick AKA Compton's human sacrifice (yeah)

Cocaine, weed
Nigga's been mixing shit since the 80's, loc
Sherm sticks, butt-nakeds, dip
Make a nigga flip
Cluck heads all up and down the block and shit
One time's crooked and shit
Block a nigga in
Alondra, Rosecrans, Bullis, it's Compton

I'm still in the hood
Loc yeah that's cool (chyea)
The hood took me under so I follow the rules
But yeah that's like me, I grew up in the hood where they bang
And niggas that rep colors is doing the same thing
Pass it to the left so I can smoke on me
A couple drive-bys in the hood lately (chyea)
Couple of IV's with the fucking spray-can
Shots in the crowd then everybody ran
Crew I'm finna slay, the street life I crave
Shots hit the enemy, harsh turn brave
Mount up regulators in the whip
Down the boulevard with the pistol grip (chyea)
Trip, we in the hood still
So loc, grab a strap 'cause chyeah, it's so real (chyea)
Deal with the outcome, a strap in the hand
And a bird and ten grand's where motherfuckers stand

If I told you I killed a nigga at sixteen, would you believe me?
Or see me to be innocent Kendrick you seen in the street
With a basketball and some Now & Laters to eat
If I mentioned all of my skeletons, would you jump in the seat?
Would you say my intelligence now is great relief?
And it's safe to say that our next generation maybe can sleep
With dreams of being a lawyer or doctor
Instead of boy with a chopper that hold the cul de sac hostage
Kill 'em all if they gossip, the Children of the Corn
They vandalizing the option of living a lie, drown their body with toxins
Constantly drinking and drive, hit the powder then watch this flame
That arrive in his eye, listen coward, the concept
is aim and then bang it and slide out that bitch with deposit
A price on his head, the tithes probably go to the projects, I
live inside the belly of the rough
Compton, U.S.A. made me an angel on angel dust, what? (Compton)

Different toilet, same shit and I drank a whole gallon
Of laxatives by accident just to shit on you has-beens
Had it been for my past tense, I wouldn't be rapping

Made me hungry, made you hate me, but fuck love

Be another example, I'll take the whole industry hostage if I have to
I'll sabotage this game, a good kid? Yeah that's only in my mama's eyes

To hopping out a minivan, with a mini 22 3s and the homie TuTu
Two more YGs
Ain't nobody got time for that!
These Days it's only time for rap!

So These Days? These accolades are meant for we
It's only truth that this shit was meant to be

Shit, what more did you expect? HiiiPower
For the most part, we go hard for the respect
I'm obviously ominous to my competition and if
I ain't better than Kendrick than nobody is then!
We shared our life with you, shared our light with you even in the darkest of hours
In hopes that one day, just maybe, one day the world'll be ours
Ha, and now they look up to us like towers for rhyming like we had super powers
They should've never let us in these offices
Knowing good and God-damn well how well we've been ducking officers
Laughing at the scraps they offered us in the past
And now we toast champagne to the thirst we never had!

Took the get well soon cards and stuffed animals
Poured the old ginger beer down the sink
Dad always told me, ""Don't you cry when you're down""
But mum, there's a tear every time that I blink

Oh, I'm in pieces, it's tearin' me up, but I know
A heart that's broke is a heart that's been loved

So I'll sing Hallelujah
You were an angel in the shape of my mum
When I fell down you'd be there holdin' me up
Spread your wings as you go
And when God takes you back
He'll say, ""Hallelujah, you're home""

I fluffed the pillows, made the beds, stacked the chairs up
Folded your nightgowns neatly in a case
John says he'd drive then put his hand on my cheek
And wiped a tear from the side of my face

And I hope that I see the world as you did 'cause I know
A life with love is a life that's been lived

So I'll sing Hallelujah
You were an angel in the shape of my mum
When I fell down you'd be there holdin' me up
Spread your wings as you go
And when God takes you back

Que contigo los voy a gastar, ey
Pa' ti siempre voy a estar
Ahora Jimmy Choo, ella nomás en su pedestal
Por ahí vienen los muchachos, me vienen a buscar
Hoy vamos pa la calle, no venga a molestar
Ando en modo leyenda, en modo rockstar
Pero yo soy tuyo y nadie lo va a cambiar
So, deja la perse, ey
Que yo soy leal a ti
Siempre voy a estar aquí, sí
Quítate la ropa y empieza a moverte, ey
Que me gusta más así
Cuando confías en mí

Ye, ye, ye
Si me altero me dice: ""Tranquilo Bobby
Lo nuestro es infinito como los Lakers con Kobe""
Las mujeres me persiguen flow Bon Jovi
Pero por mí, que se queden en el lobby

Shouldn't I find a stain, but I never do
The way the tires turn stones, on old county roads
They leave 'em muddy underneath
Reminds me of you
You find graffiti on the walls of old bathroom stalls
You know, you can scratch it right off
It's how it used to be
But like the dollar in your pocket, it's been spent and traded in
You can't change where it's been
Reminds me of me

I lived, and I learned
Had you, got burned
Held out, and held on
God knows, too long
And wasted time, lost tears
Swore that I'd get out of here
But no amount of freedom gets you clean
I've still got you all over me

The best and worst day of June
Was the one that I met you
With your hands in your pockets
And your 'don't you wish you had me' grin
But I did, so I smiled, and I melted like a child
Now every breath of air I breathe reminds me of then

And I lived, and I learned
Had you, got burned
Held out, and held on
God knows, too long
And wasted time, lost tears
Swore that I'd get out of here
But no amount of freedom gets you clean
I've still got you all over me

I lived, and I learned
And found out what it was to turn around
And see, that we
Were never really meant to be

Retrograde energy shifts are what I was made for
And don't you dare hit me back with no ""K, sure""

You too saucy, too flossy, you moved in and moved off me
All to be with niggas who just startin' to move bossy
Maybe I just handled you too softly
Them boys got no Kelis in they blood
If your whole heart wasn't in it, I know a piece of it was
Posted that pic you sent me, it wasn't recent enough
How I'm supposed to wife it? You not Ayesha enough
You love getting T'd up
Love showin' the cakes, you know that they eat it up
Love touching the road as soon as it's heatin' up
Invited you over, you said that you showin' up
All them spelling mistakes, I know that you drunk as fuck
All them other mistakes, let's let it be what it was

Hung around long enough to catch a break
Couple hundred songs and the ones that finally worked
Was the one about a car and the one about a church

We some killers, walkin' zombies, tryna scratch that itch
Germaphobic, hetero and

I am not for the faint of heart
My genetic build can build multi-universes, the man of God
Playin' ""Baby Shark"" with my daughter
Watchin' for sharks outside at the same time
Life as a protective father, I'd kill for her
My son Enoch is the part two
When I expire, my children'll make higher valleys
In this present moment, I saw that through
Ask Whitney about my lust addiction
Text messagin' bitches got my thumbs hurt
Set precedent for a new sacreligion
Writer's block for two years, nothin' moved me
Asked God to speak through me, that's what you hear now
The voice of yours truly
Teleport out my own body for comfort
I don't pass judgment, past life regressions keep me in question
Where did I come from? I don't think like I used to
No, I don't blink like I used to
Awkward stares at everybody, see the flesh of man
But still, this man compared to nobody
Yesterday, I prayed to the flowers and trees
Gratification to the powers that be
Synchronization with my energy chakras, the ghost of Dr. Sebi
Paid it forward, cleaned out my toxins, bacteria heavy
Sciatica nerve pinch, I don't know how to feel
Like the first time I fucked a white bitch

The first time I fucked a white bitch
I was sixteen at the Palisades
Fumblin' my grades, I traveled with the team
The apache life, Centennial was like
When Ms. Baker screamed at Doughboy
Mixed that with Purple Rain
They interchanged the seams
Happy just to be out the hood
With all the wealthy kids
Credit cards and family plans
She drove her daddy's Benz
I found out that he was a sheriff
That was a win-win
Because he had locked up Uncle Perry
She paid her daddy's sins
Next time I fucked a white bitch
Was out in Copenhagen
good kid, m.A.A.d city tour
I flourished on them stages
Whitney asked did I have a problem
I said, ""I might be racist""
Ancestors watchin' me fuck was like retaliation

Not because the rags in the park had red gradient
But because the high blood pressure flooded the caterin'

More fatalities and reality brung you closure

996,37353,2018,ROD WAVE & SADIE JEAN,2023,"I saw you in the back of my show last night
Standing underneath the exit sign
I know it wasn't really you though
'Cause you were always in the front row
And I've been looking for love online
And maybe some of them are real good guys
They're never gonna be like you though
You set the bar above the moon, so

I don't wanna be twenty-something
And still in my head about
Seventeen, in my bedroom talking
You said that by now
We'd paint the walls of our shared apartment
You're still everything I want, and
I think we could work it out
So what are you doin' now?

Now that you finally got the job you like
I'm making money off the songs I write
I know you said that I could call you
I wonder if you wanna call too
Now that the future doesn't feel so far
It doesn't seem as wrong to want what's ours
And after everything that's happened
I wanna put it in the past tense

'Cause I don't wanna be twenty-something
And still in my head about
Seventeen, in my bedroom talking
You said that by now
We'd paint the walls of our shared apartment
You're still everything I want, and
I think we could work it out
So what are you doin' now?

Look, uh
My tongue get twisted and I don't know what to say
Should've picked up the phone, but my pride got in the way
Only nineteen and we was in and out of state
By the time I turned twenty, I was opening up for Gates
And before the money, we had everything
Should've took you out the country, but was scared of planes
All the niggas I came in the game with
Either faded or they still on the same shit
But Noonie, he lane switched
To arena tours, marble floors
Gave my life to my dream but my heart was yours
Youngin made it out the trenches, really went the distance
Something they can't ignore
Rappers pretend to be friends, but they really wanna pass me
""Wave, let's do a song,"" that's the first thing they ask me
Jumbotron jumpin' like I came off Degrassi
Twenty-million-dollar mansion like an athlete
But my house ain't a home 'cause I'm in it alone
Couldn't right my wrongs, so I was writin' songs
Such a successful life, but my heart is gone
Waitin' for you to call my phone
'Cause I don't-

I don't wanna be twenty-something
And still in my head about
Seventeen in my bedroom talking
You said that by now
We'd paint the walls of our shared apartment
You're still everything I want, and
I think we could work it out

I've been up since 4 AM
At your worst, you're better than my better days
There ain't been no sun in LA
Since you moved out of Sarah's place

I love your mother's stories 'bout you as a kid
I heard you scored a job in the east village
While working for some folks who don't know your name
Well, ain't you gonna miss all of them wasted days?
We'd sit around, drinkin' out at Sarah's place

Don't come back lover, I'm proud you're under the skyline
We always knew you were the better half of our good times
Those backyard lights don't shine as bright without your face
Out at Sarah's Place

And you called to talk just last week
I'm still fallin' apart like I'll always be
And your picnic chair is still sittin' there in the yard
And I had to sell my old guitar

But don't come back lover, I'm proud you're under the skyline
We always knew you were the better half of our good times
Those backyard lights don't shine as bright without your face
Out at Sarah's Place

You'll always be a piece of mine, a piece of mine
We drove that road we know at least a million times
I'm so damn tired of seeing that empty drive
Out at Sarah's Place

Look at me and don't you lie
I could be your sacrifice
But don't you hold your head up high
For bullshit, I do not have time
I can be an old tattoo
To remind me when I get bad news
That I do not exist to die
But live to die while saving you

Do you lie awake restless?
Why am I so obsessive?

They're gone before they hit my cheeks

Or maybe something's changin' me

Then you don't know how well I sleep
You love me and I don't know why
